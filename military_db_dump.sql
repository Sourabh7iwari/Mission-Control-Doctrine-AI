This \nrepresents the evolution in our warfighting guidance and military theory that forms the core \nof joint warfighting doctrine and establishes the framework for our forces’ ability to fight \nas a joint team.  \nIt is vital that we not only develop our military capabilities, but also strengthen the \ncapacity of other government departments and agencies.  This publication ties joint \ndoctrine to the national security strategy and national military strategy and describes the \nmilitary’s role in the development of national policy and strategy.  It thus provides the \nlinkage between joint doctrine and the contribution of other government departments and \nagencies and multinational endeavors. \n \nAs we look globally at our posture and the associated strategic risk, it is imperative \nthat our doctrine also rapidly adjust to reflect our wartime footing.  The guidance in this \npublication will enable current and future leaders of the Armed Forces of the United States \nto organize, train, and execute worldwide missions as our forces transform to meet \nemerging challenges.  The joint force must simultaneously think ahead at the strategic \nlevel, stay current at the operational level, and be informed by tactical level developments. \n \nI challenge all commanders to ensure the widest distribution of this capstone joint \npublication and actively promote the use of all joint publications at every opportunity.  I \nfurther challenge you to study and understand the guidance contained in this publication \nand	Federation of American Scientists
america_doctrine_1	America		teach these principles to your subordinates.  Only then will we be able to fully exploit \nthe remarkable military potential inherent in our joint teams. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nMARTIN E. DEMPSEY \n \nGeneral, U.S. Army \n \n \ni \n \nPREFACE \n1.  Scope \nThis publication is the capstone joint doctrine publication and provides doctrine for \nunified action by the Armed Forces of the United States.  It specifies the authorized \ncommand relationships and authority that military commanders can use, provides guidance \nfor the exercise of that military authority, provides fundamental principles and guidance \nfor command and control, prescribes guidance for organizing and developing joint forces, \nand describes policy for selected joint activities.  It also provides the doctrinal basis for \ninteragency coordination and for US military involvement in multiagency and \nmultinational operations. \n2.  Purpose \na.  The US Armed Forces fulfill unique and crucial roles, defending the US against all \nadversaries while serving the Nation as a bulwark and the guarantor of its security and \nindependence.  The US Armed Forces function within the American system of civil-\nmilitary relations and serve under the civilian control of the President, the Commander in \nChief.  The US Armed Forces embody the highest values and standards of American \nsociety and the profession of arms.   \nb.  The nature of the challenges to the US and its interests demand that the Armed \nForces operate as a closely integrated joint team with interagency and multinational \npartners across the range of military operations.  Using a whole-of-government approach \nis essential to advancing our interests to strengthen security relationships and capacity by, \nwith, and through military forces of partner nations, US and foreign government agencies, \nstate and local government agencies, and intergovernmental or nongovernmental \norganizations.  To succeed, we must refine and proportionally integrate the military with \nall of the tools	Federation of American Scientists
america_doctrine_2	America		of American power and work with our partner nations to do the same.  Our \nmilitary must maintain its conventional superiority while continuing to enhance its capacity \nto defeat threats.  As long as nuclear weapons exist, our nuclear deterrent capability must \nalso be maintained and modernized.  When international forces are needed to respond to \nthreats and keep the peace, we will make every effort to ensure international partners are \nready, able, and willing.  We will continue to build support in other countries and promote \nglobal peace and stability through the United Nations and other regional organizations, \nsuch as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the African Union. \nc.  Joint Operations.  Effective integration of joint forces is intended to address \nfunctional or geographic vulnerabilities.  This does not mean that all forces will be equally \nrepresented in each operation.  Joint force commanders (JFCs) may choose the capabilities \nthey need from the forces at their disposal. \nPreface \nii \nJP 1 \n3.  Application \na.  This publication is written to assist members of the Armed Forces of the United \nStates, including the National Guard, to operate successfully together.  The joint team is \ncomposed of the members of each Service, Department of Defense agencies, as well as \nassociated civilians supporting governmental and private sector workforces.  The guidance \nin this publication is broad, authoritative, and serves as a foundation for the development \nof more specific joint guidance.  This doctrine will be followed except when, in the \njudgment of the commander, exceptional circumstances dictate otherwise.   \nb.  To ensure the Armed Forces achieve their fullest potential, all US military leaders \nshall incorporate the doctrine and philosophy of this publication into their efforts to develop \nleaders and train forces for joint and multinational operations.  JFCs shall incorporate the \nguidelines and philosophies of this doctrine as fundamental	Federation of American Scientists
america_doctrine_3	America		precepts while conducting \ninteragency coordination.  \nc.  The Services and United States Special Operations Command (in areas unique to \nspecial operations) have specific responsibilities under Title 10, United States Code (USC), \nto organize, train, equip, prepare, and maintain their forces.  The National Guard has \nsimilar, specific responsibilities under Title 32, USC, and includes domestic operations.  \nThese forces are employed under JFCs. Service equipment, systems, and manpower skills \nform the very core of US military capability.  Joint warfare relies upon effective \ncoordination of Service capabilities and expertise.  When integrated into joint operations \nwith partner military Services and other defense, logistical, and intelligence agencies, they \nbecome capable of unified action.  Successful joint operations merge capabilities and skill \nsets of assigned Service components.  Interoperability and effective integration of service \ncapabilities enhance joint operations to accomplish US Government objective(s), building \non US traditions of conducting joint operations that began with the Revolutionary War.  \nd.  The growing threats to US and allied interests throughout the world demand US \nforces be proficient across the range of military operations.  The fundamental principles \nthat guide operations are recorded in joint doctrine.  Joint operations are conducted \nroutinely and efficiently in the current operational environment.  To maintain and enhance \nthis efficiency, joint leaders must diligently study, apply, teach, and ultimately provide \ninsights to improve joint doctrine. \niii \nSUMMARY OF CHANGES \nREVISION OF JOINT PUBLICATION 1, DATED 02 MAY 2007, \nCHANGE 1, DATED 20 MARCH 2009 \n• \nAdds a theory section to the introductory chapter. \n• \nAdds a joint force development chapter, including a section on joint concepts and \nassessment. \n• \nEstablishes a taxonomy relating to war, warfare, campaign, and operation. \n• \nEstablishes a taxonomy relating to	Federation of American Scientists

india_Air_doctrine_0	India	Air	Fall 2018 | 21\nRealignment and Indian Airpower Doctrine \nChallenges in an Evolving Strategic Context\nDr. Christina Goulter\nProf. Harsh Pant\n Disclaimer: The views and opinions expressed or implied in the Journal are those of the authors \nand should not be construed as carrying the official sanction of the Department of Defense, Air \nForce, Air Education and Training Command, Air University, or other agencies or departments of \nthe US government. This article may be reproduced in whole or in part without permission. If it is \nreproduced, the Journal of Indo-Pacific Affairs requests a courtesy line.\nW\nith a shift in the balance of power in the Far East, as well as multiple chal­\nlenges in the wider international security environment, several nations in \nthe Indo-Pacific region have undergone significant changes in their defense pos­\ntures. This is particularly the case with India, which has gone from a regional, \nlargely Pakistan-focused, perspective to one involving global influence and power \nprojection. This has presented ramifications for all the Indian armed services, but \nespecially the Indian Air Force (IAF). Over the last decade, the IAF has been trans­\nforming itself from a principally army-support instrument to a broad spectrum air \nforce, and this prompted a radical revision of Indian aipower doctrine in 2012. It is \nakin to Western airpower thought, but much of the latest doctrine is indigenous \nand demonstrates some unique conceptual work, not least in the way maritime air­\npower is used to protect Indian territories in the Indian Ocean and safeguard sea \nlines of communication. Because of this, it is starting to have traction in Anglo-\nAmerican defense circles.1 The current Indian emphases on strategic reach and con­\nventional deterrence have been prompted by other events as well, not least the 1999 \nKargil conflict between India and Pakistan, which demonstrated that India lacked a \nbalanced defense apparatus. This article examines the evolving doctrinal	Dr. Christina Goulter, Prof. Harsh Pant - airuniversity.af.edu
india_Air_doctrine_1	India	Air	thinking of \nthe IAF and argues that the service is transformational in the way it situates the use \nof airpower in addressing India’s security environment.2\nThe IAF is currently the fourth-largest air service in the world, with nearly \n1,500 aircraft, and, for this reason alone, it merits far greater attention than has \nbeen the case to date.3 But it is also one of the oldest independent air forces, hav­\ning been established in 1932. Since that time, it has been involved in a variety of \n22 | Journal of Indo-Pacific Affairs\nGoulter & Pant\nconflicts, including high-end, regular conventional warfare during WWII through \nto what can be categorized as counterinsurgency (COIN) and counterterrorism \noperations, including action against tribal groups in Waziristan. However, in spite \nof this extensive experience, the IAF has lacked a comprehensive doctrine and bal­\nanced force structure and has primarily served two masters since its inception: the \nIndian Army and nuclear deterrence. This has had a variety of consequences, not \nleast a defensive and reactive posture. Since independence, India has done its ut­\nmost to prevent escalation of conflict with Pakistan and, in spite of numerous in­\ncursions into its territory, has managed to contain the violence.4 These engage­\nments between India and Pakistan, and, in one case, with China, should not be \nseen merely as border skirmishes; China and Pakistan have compelled India to \nfight five separate high-intensity conflicts, in addition to numerous low-intensity \nclashes. 5 What is particularly significant about all the major conflicts waged by In­\ndia is that the 1962 war with China was the only one they lost, and it is the only \nconflict during which Indian airpower was not employed. In all other instances, \nthe Indian forces managed to turn the tide with the assistance of airpower. But \nwhat is also notable about all the conflicts up to the end of the 1990s is that les­\nsons over and above the tactical level were not taken	Dr. Christina Goulter, Prof. Harsh Pant - airuniversity.af.edu

It is a bridge between policy\nand doctrine and describes the authorized command\nrelationships and authority that military commanders\ncan use and other operational matters derived from Title\n10, United States Code (USC).  The purpose of joint\ndoctrine is to enhance the operational effectiveness of\njoint forces by providing fundamental principles that \nguide the employment of US military forces toward a\ncommon objective.	Federation of American Scientists
america_doctrine_13	America		Jointness of the Joint Force \nJointness implies cross-Service combination wherein \nthe capability of the joint force is understood to be\nsynergistic, with the sum greater than its parts (the \ncapability of individual components).  The joint force is\na values based organization.  The character,\nprofessionalism, and values of our military leaders have\nproven to be vital for operational success.  \nWar is socially sanctioned \nviolence to achieve a political \npurpose. \nWar can result from the failure of states to resolve their\ndisputes by diplomatic means.  War historically involves\nnine principles, collectively and classically known as the\nprinciples of war (objective, offensive, mass, economy \nof force, maneuver, unity of command, security,\nsurprise, and simplicity). \nWarfare is the mechanism, \nmethod, or modality of armed \nWarfare continues to change and be transformed by\nsociety, diplomacy, politics, and technology.  The US\nExecutive Summary \nx \nJP 1 \nconflict against an enemy.  \nIt is “the how” of waging war. \nmilitary recognizes two basic forms of warfare—\ntraditional and irregular. The forms of warfare are\napplied not in terms of an “either/or” choice, but in\nvarious combinations to suit a combatant’s strategy and \ncapabilities. \nThe US military recognizes  \ntwo basic forms of warfare—\ntraditional and irregular. \nA useful dichotomy for thinking about warfare is the\ndistinction between traditional and irregular warfare\n(IW).  Traditional warfare is characterized as a violent \nstruggle for domination between nation-states or \ncoalitions and alliances of nation-states.  With the \nincreasingly rare case of formally declared war,\ntraditional warfare typically involves force-on-force \nmilitary operations in which adversaries employ a \nvariety of conventional forces and special operations\nforces (SOF) against each other in all physical domains\nas well as the information environment (which includes\ncyberspace).  IW is characterized as a violent struggle \namong state and	Federation of American Scientists
america_doctrine_14	America		non-state actors for legitimacy and \ninfluence over the relevant population(s).  In IW, a less\npowerful adversary seeks to disrupt or negate the\nmilitary capabilities and advantages of a more powerful\nmilitary force, which usually serves that nation’s \nestablished government.  \nLevels of Warfare \nWhile the various forms and methods of warfare are\nultimately expressed in concrete military action, the\nthree levels of warfare—strategic, operational, and \ntactical—link tactical actions to achievement of national \nobjectives.  There are no finite limits or boundaries \nbetween these levels, but they help commanders design\nand synchronize operations, allocate resources, and\nassign tasks to the appropriate command. \nCampaigns and Operations \nAn operation is a sequence of tactical actions with a \ncommon purpose or unifying theme.  An operation may\nentail the process of carrying on combat, including\nmovement, supply, attack, defense, and maneuvers\nneeded to achieve the objective of any battle or\ncampaign.  A campaign is a series of related major \noperations aimed at achieving strategic and operational\nobjectives within a given time and space. \nTask, Function, and Mission \nA task is a clearly defined action or activity assigned to \nan individual or organization.  It is a specific assignment\nthat must be done as it is imposed by an appropriate\nauthority.  A function is the broad, general, and \n \nExecutive Summary \nxi \nenduring role for which an organization is designed,\nequipped, and trained.  Mission entails the task, together \nwith the purpose, that clearly indicates the action to be \ntaken and the reason therefore. \nStrategic Security  \nEnvironment and National \nSecurity Challenges \nThe strategic security environment is characterized by \nuncertainty, complexity, rapid change, and persistent\nconflict.  This environment is fluid, with continually \nchanging alliances, partnerships, and new national and\ntransnational \nthreats \nconstantly \nappearing \nand\ndisappearing.  The	Federation of American Scientists
america_doctrine_15	America		strategic security environment\npresents broad national security challenges likely to\nrequire the employment of joint forces in the future.  The \nUS military will undertake the following activities to\ndeal with these challenges: secure the homeland, win the\nNation’s \nwars, \ndeter \nour \nadversaries, \nsecurity\ncooperation, support to civil authorities, and adapt to\nchanging environment.   \nInstruments of National Power \nand the Range of Military \nOperations \nThe ability of the US to advance its national interests is\ndependent on the effectiveness of the United States\nGovernment (USG) in employing the instruments of\nnational power to achieve national strategic objectives. \nThe military instrument of national power can be used\nin a wide variety of ways that vary in purpose, scale,\nrisk, and combat intensity.  These various ways can be\nunderstood to occur across a continuum of conflict \nranging from peace to war.  Mindful that the operational\nlevel of warfare connects the tactical to the strategic, and\noperations and campaigns are themselves scalable, the\nUS uses the construct of the range of military operations\nto provide insight into the various broad usages of \nmilitary power from a strategic perspective. \nJoint Operations \nAlthough individual Services may plan and conduct\noperations to accomplish tasks and missions in support\nof Department of Defense (DOD) objectives, the\nprimary way DOD employs two or more Services (from \ntwo Military Departments) in a single operation,\nparticularly in combat, is through joint operations.  Joint\noperations is the general term to describe military\nactions conducted by joint forces and those Service\nforces in specified command relationships with each\nother. \nJoint Functions \nThere \nare \nsignificant \nchallenges \nto \neffectively\nintegrating and synchronizing Service and combat\nExecutive Summary \nxii \nJP 1 \nsupport agency (CSA) capabilities in joint operations.\nFunctionally related capabilities and activities can be \ngrouped.  These	Federation of American Scientists
america_doctrine_16	America		groupings, which we call joint \nfunctions, facilitate planning and employment of the \njoint force.  In addition to command and control (C2),\nthe \njoint \nfunctions \ninclude\nintelligence, \nfires, \nmovement \nand \nmaneuver,\nprotection, sustainment, and information.   \nJoint Operation Planning \n \n \n \nJoint operation planning is  \nthe way the military links and \ntransforms national strategic \nobjectives into tactical actions. \nJoint operation planning provides a common basis for\ndiscussion, understanding, and change for the joint \nforce, its subordinate and higher headquarters, the joint\nplanning and execution community, and the national\nleadership.  In accordance with the Guidance for \nEmployment of the Force (GEF), adaptive planning \nsupports the transition of DOD planning from a \ncontingency-centric approach to a strategy-centric \napproach.  The Adaptive Planning and Execution \n(APEX) system facilitates iterative dialogue and \ncollaborative planning between the multiple echelons of\ncommand.  The combatant commanders’ (CCDRs’) \nparticipation in the Joint Strategic Planning System and\nAPEX system helps to ensure that warfighting and\npeacetime operational concerns are emphasized in all\nplanning documents. \nLaw of War \nIt is DOD policy that the Armed Forces of the United \nStates will adhere to the law of war, often called the law\nof armed conflict, during all military operations.  The\nlaw of war is the body of law that regulates both the legal\nand customary justifications for utilizing force and the\nconduct of armed hostilities; it is binding on the US and\nits individual citizens. \nDoctrine Governing Unified Direction of Armed Forces \nNational Strategic Direction \nNational strategic direction is governed by the \nConstitution, \nUS \nlaw, \nUSG \npolicy \nregarding\ninternationally recognized law, and the national interest\nas represented by national security policy.  This\ndirection leads to unified action.  National policy and\nplanning documents generally provide national	Federation of American Scientists
america_doctrine_17	America		strategic\ndirection. \n \nExecutive Summary \nxiii \nStrategic Guidance and \nResponsibilities \nThe national security strategy (NSS) provides a broad \nstrategic context for employing military capabilities in\nconcert with other instruments of national power. \n \nThe national defense strategy (NDS), signed by \nSecretary of Defense (SecDef), outlines DOD’s \napproach to implementing the President’s NSS. \nThe National Military Strategy, signed by the \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS), supports\nthe aims of the NSS and implements the NDS.  It\ndescribes the Armed Forces’ plan to achieve military \nobjectives in the near term and provides a vision for\nmaintaining a force capable of meeting future\nchallenges. \nThe GEF provides Presidential and SecDef politico-\nmilitary guidance.  The GEF is guided by the Unified\nCommand Plan (UCP) and NDS and forms the basis for \nstrategic policy guidance, campaign plans, and the Joint\nStrategic Capabilities Plan.   \nThe National Response Framework, developed by the \nDepartment of Homeland Security, establishes a\ncomprehensive, \nnational-level, \nall-hazards, \nall-\ndiscipline approach to domestic incident management. \nUnified Action \nUnified action synchronizes, coordinates, and/or \nintegrates joint, single-Service, and multinational \noperations with the operations of other USG\ndepartments \nand \nagencies, \nnongovernmental \norganizations (NGOs), intergovernmental organizations \n(IGOs) (e.g., the United Nations), and the private sector \nto achieve unity of effort.  Unity of command within \nthe military instrument of national power supports the \nnational strategic direction through close coordination \nwith the other instruments of national power.  The CJCS\nand all CCDRs are in pivotal positions to facilitate the\nplanning and conduct of unified actions in accordance\nwith the guidance and direction received from the\nPresident and SecDef in coordination with other \nauthorities (i.e., multinational leadership). \nRoles and Functions \nRoles are	Federation of American Scientists
america_doctrine_18	America		the broad and enduring purposes for which the \nServices and the combatant commands (CCMDs) were\nestablished in law.  Functions are the appropriate \nExecutive Summary \nxiv \nJP 1 \nassigned duties, responsibilities, missions, or tasks of an \nindividual, office, or organization. \nChain of Command \nThe President and SecDef exercise authority, direction,\nand control of the Armed Forces through two distinct\nbranches of the chain of C2.  One branch runs from the \nPresident, through SecDef, to the CCDRs for missions\nand forces assigned to their commands.    For purposes\nother than the operational direction of the CCMDs, the\nchain of command runs from the President to SecDef to\nthe Secretaries of the Military Departments and, as \nprescribed by the Secretaries, to the commanders of\nMilitary Service forces.  The Military Departments,\norganized separately, operate under the authority,\ndirection, and control of the Secretary of that Military\nDepartment.  The Secretaries of the Military \nDepartments exercise administrative control (ADCON)\nover Service retained forces through their respective\nService Chiefs.  CCDRs prescribe the chain of\ncommand within their CCMDs and designate the\nappropriate command authority to be exercised by \nsubordinate commanders. \nUnified Command Plan \nThe President, through the UCP, establishes CCMDs.\nCommanders of unified CCMDs may establish\nsubordinate unified commands when so authorized by\nSecDef. \nCombatant Commands \nCCDRs exercise combatant command (command \nauthority) (COCOM) of assigned forces.  The CCDR\nmay delegate operational control (OPCON), tactical\ncontrol (TACON), or establish support command\nrelationships of assigned forces.  Unless otherwise\ndirected by the President or SecDef, COCOM may not \nbe delegated.  \nMilitary Departments,  \nServices, Forces, Combat \nSupport Agencies, and  \nNational Guard Bureau \nThe Secretaries of the Military Departments are\nresponsible for the administration and support of\nService forces.  They fulfill their	Federation of American Scientists
america_doctrine_19	America		responsibilities by \nexercising ADCON through the Service Chiefs.  Service\nChiefs have ADCON for all forces of their Service.\nCommanders of Service forces are responsible to\nSecretaries of the Military Departments through their\nrespective Service Chiefs for the administration, \ntraining, and readiness of their unit(s).  The National\nGuard Bureau is responsible for ensuring that units and\nmembers of the Army National Guard and the Air\n \nExecutive Summary \nxv \nNational Guard are trained by the states to provide\ntrained and equipped units to fulfill assigned missions in \nfederal and non-federal statuses.  In addition to the \nServices above, a number of DOD agencies provide\ncombat support or combat service support to joint forces\nand are designated as CSAs.  The CSA directors are\naccountable to SecDef. \nRelationship Between \nCombatant Commanders, \nMilitary Department \nSecretaries, Service Chiefs,  \nand Forces \nThe Services and United States Special Operations\nCommand (USSOCOM) (in areas unique to special\noperations [SO]) share the division of responsibility for \ndeveloping military capabilities for the CCMDs.\nUnified action demands maximum interoperability.  The\nforces, units, and systems of all Services must operate\ntogether effectively, in part through interoperability.\nCCDRs will ensure maximum interoperability and \nidentify interoperability issues to the CJCS, who has\noverall responsibility for the joint interoperability\nprogram. \nInteragency Coordination \nInteragency coordination is the cooperation and\ncommunication that occurs between departments and \nagencies of the USG, including DOD, to accomplish an\nobjective.  CCDRs and subordinate joint force\ncommanders (JFCs) must consider the potential\nrequirements \nfor \ninteragency, \nIGO, \nand \nNGO\ncoordination as a part of their activities within and \noutside of their operational areas.  Unity of effort can \nonly be achieved through close, continuous interagency\nand interdepartmental coordination and cooperation,\nwhich	Federation of American Scientists
america_doctrine_20	America		are necessary to overcome discord, inadequate\nstructure \nand \nprocedures, \nincompatible\ncommunications, cultural differences, and bureaucratic\nand personnel limitations. \nMultinational Operations \nOperations conducted by  \nforces of two or more nations \nare termed “multinational \noperations.” \nMuch of the information and guidance provided for\nunified action and joint operations are applicable to \nmultinational operations.  However, differences in laws,\ndoctrine, \norganization, \nweapons, \nequipment,\nterminology, culture, politics, religion, and language\nwithin alliances and coalitions must be considered.\nAttaining unity of effort through unity of command for\na multinational operation may not be politically feasible,\nbut it should be a goal.

DOD is composed of the \nOffice of the Secretary of Defense, the Military\nDepartments, the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS), the Joint\nStaff, \nthe \nCCMDs, \nthe \nInspector \nGeneral,\nagencies/bureaus, field activities, and such other offices,\nagencies, activities, and commands established or \ndesignated by law, by the President, or by SecDef.  As\nprescribed by higher authority, DOD will maintain and\nemploy Armed Forces to: support and defend the\nConstitution of the US against all enemies, foreign and\ndomestic; ensure, by timely and effective military \naction,	Federation of American Scientists

The CJCS is the\nprincipal military advisor to the President, National\nSecurity Council, Homeland Security Council, and\nSecDef. \nCommon Functions of the \nServices and the United States \nSpecial Operations Command \nSubject to the authority, direction, and control of SecDef\nand subject to the provisions of Title 10, USC, the Army,\nMarine Corps, Navy, and Air Force, under their\nrespective Secretaries, are responsible for the functions\nprescribed in detail in Department of Defense Directive \n5100.01, Functions of the DOD and Its Major \nComponents.  USSOCOM is unique among the CCMDs \nin that it performs certain Service-like functions (in \nareas unique to SO) (Title 10, USC, Sections 161 and\n167). \nCombatant Commanders \nGeographic combatant commanders (GCCs) are \nassigned a geographic area of responsibility (AOR) by\nthe President with the advice of SecDef as specified in\nthe UCP.

In accordance with the \nNational Security Act of 1947 and Title 10, USC, and as\ndescribed in the UCP, CCMDs are established by the \nPresident, through SecDef, with the advice and \nassistance of the CJCS.  Commanders of unified\ncombatant commands may establish subordinate unified \ncommands when so authorized by SecDef through the\nCJCS.  Joint task forces (JTFs) can be established by\nSecDef, a CCDR, subordinate unified commander, or an \nexisting JTF commander. \n \nExecutive Summary \nxix \nUnified Combatant  \nCommand \nA unified combatant command is a command with \nbroad continuing missions under a single commander\nand composed of significant assigned components of\ntwo or more Military Departments that is established\nand so designated by the President through SecDef and \nwith the advice and assistance of the CJCS. \nSpecified Combatant  \nCommand \nA specified CCMD is a command that has broad\ncontinuing missions and is established by the President,\nthrough SecDef, with the advice and assistance of the \nCJCS. \nSubordinate Unified  \nCommand \nWhen authorized by SecDef through the CJCS,\ncommanders of unified CCMDs may establish \nsubordinate unified commands (also called	Federation of American Scientists
america_doctrine_24	America		subunified\ncommands) to conduct operations on a continuing basis \nin accordance with the criteria set forth for unified\nCCMDs. \nJoint Task Force \nA JTF is a joint force that is constituted and so\ndesignated by SecDef, a CCDR, a subordinate unified\ncommander, or an existing JTF commander.  A JTF may \nbe established on a geographical area or functional basis\nwhen the mission has a specific limited objective and\ndoes not require overall centralized control of logistics.\nCommander Responsibilities \nAlthough specific responsibilities will vary, a JFC\npossesses the following general responsibilities: \n \nProvide a clear commander’s intent and timely \ncommunication of specified tasks, together with\nany \nrequired \ncoordinating \nand \nreporting\nrequirements.   \n \nTransfer forces and other capabilities to designated\nsubordinate \ncommanders \nfor \naccomplishing \nassigned tasks. \n \nProvide all available information to subordinate\nJFCs and component commanders that affect their \nassigned missions and objectives. \n \nDelegate authority to subordinate JFCs and \ncomponent commanders commensurate with their \nresponsibilities. \nStaff of a Joint Force \nA JFC is authorized to organize the staff and assign\nresponsibilities to individual Service members assigned\nto the staff as deemed necessary to accomplish assigned\nmissions.  The composition of a joint staff should be \nExecutive Summary \nxx \nJP 1 \ncommensurate with the composition of forces and the\ncharacter of the contemplated operations to ensure that\nthe staff understands the capabilities, needs, and\nlimitations of each element of the force. \nService Component  \nCommands \nA Service component command, assigned to a CCDR, \nconsists of the Service component commander and the\nService forces (such as individuals, units, detachments,\nand organizations, including the support forces) that\nhave been assigned to that CCDR.  Forces assigned to\nCCDRs are identified in the Global Force Management \nImplementation Guidance (GFMIG) signed by	Federation of American Scientists
america_doctrine_25	America		SecDef.\nFunctional Component \nCommands \nJFCs have the authority to establish functional \ncomponent commands to control military operations.\nJFCs may decide to establish a functional component \ncommand to integrate planning; reduce their span of\ncontrol; and/or significantly improve combat efficiency,\ninformation flow, unity of effort, weapon systems\nmanagement, component interaction, or control over the\nscheme of maneuver. \nDiscipline \nThe JFC is responsible for the discipline of military\npersonnel assigned to the joint organization.  Each\nService component in a CCMD is responsible for the \ndiscipline of that Service’s component forces, subject to\nService regulations and directives established by the \nCCDR.  The Uniform Code of Military Justice is federal\nlaw, as enacted by Congress; it provides the basic law\nfor discipline of the Armed Forces of the United States.\nMatters that involve more than one Service and that are\nwithin the jurisdiction of the JFC may be handled either \nby the JFC or by the appropriate Service component\ncommander.  Matters that involve only one Service\nshould be handled by the Service component\ncommander, subject to Service regulations. \nJoint Command and Control \nCommand is central to all \nmilitary action, and unity of \ncommand is central to  \nunity of effort. \nInherent in command is the authority that a military\ncommander lawfully exercises over subordinates \nincluding \nauthority \nto \nassign \nmissions \nand\naccountability \nfor \ntheir \nsuccessful \ncompletion. \nAlthough commanders may delegate authority to\naccomplish \nmissions, \nthey \nmay \nnot \nabsolve\nthemselves of the responsibility for the attainment of\nthese missions.  Authority is never absolute; the extent \n \nExecutive Summary \nxxi \nof authority is specified by the establishing authority, \ndirectives, and law. \nCombatant Command \n(Command Authority) \nCOCOM provides full authority for a CCDR to perform \nthose functions of command over assigned forces\ninvolving organizing and employing	Federation of American Scientists
america_doctrine_26	America		commands and\nforces, assigning tasks, designating objectives, and \ngiving authoritative direction over all aspects of military\noperations, joint training (or in the case of USSOCOM,\ntraining of assigned forces), and logistics necessary to\naccomplish the missions assigned to the command. \nOperational Control \nOPCON is the command authority that may be exercised\nby commanders at any echelon at or below the level of\nCCMD and may be delegated within the command.\nOPCON is able to be delegated from and lesser authority\nthan COCOM.  It is the authority to perform those \nfunctions of command over subordinate forces involving\norganizing and employing commands and forces,\nassigning tasks, designating objectives, and giving\nauthoritative direction over all aspects of military\noperations and joint training necessary to accomplish the \nmission. \nTactical Control \nTACON is an authority over assigned or attached forces\nor commands, or military capability or forces made\navailable for tasking, that is limited to the detailed\ndirection and control of movements and maneuvers \nwithin the operational area necessary to accomplish\nassigned missions or tasks assigned by the commander\nexercising OPCON or TACON of the attached force.\nTACON is able to be delegated from and lesser authority\nthan OPCON and may be delegated to and exercised by \ncommanders at any echelon at or below the level of\nCCMD.   \nSupport \n \nThere are four categories of \nsupport that a combatant \ncommander may exercise  \nover assigned or attached  \nforces to ensure the  \nappropriate level of support  \nis provided to accomplish \nSupport is a command authority.  A support relationship \nis established by a common superior commander\nbetween \nsubordinate \ncommanders \nwhen \none \norganization should aid, protect, complement, or sustain\nanother force.  Support may be exercised by \ncommanders at any echelon at or below the CCMD\nlevel.  The designation of supporting relationships is\nimportant as it conveys priorities to commanders	Federation of American Scientists
america_doctrine_27	America		and \nstaffs that are planning or executing joint operations.\nThe support command relationship is, by design, a\nsomewhat vague but very flexible arrangement.  The\nExecutive Summary \nxxii \nJP 1 \nmission objectives.  They are:  \ngeneral support, mutual \nsupport, direct support, and \nclose support. \nestablishing authority (the common JFC) is responsible \nfor ensuring that both the supported commander and \nsupporting commanders understand the degree of\nauthority that the supported commander is granted. \nSupport Relationships  \nBetween Combatant \nCommanders \nSecDef establishes support relationships between the\nCCDRs for the planning and execution of joint \noperations.  This ensures that the supported CCDR \nreceives the necessary support. \nSupport Relationships  \nBetween Component \nCommanders \nThe JFC may establish support relationships between\ncomponent commanders to facilitate operations.\nComponent commanders should establish liaison with \nother component commanders to facilitate the support\nrelationship and to coordinate the planning and\nexecution of pertinent operations. \nCommand Relationships  \nand Assignment and  \nTransfer of Forces \nAll forces under the jurisdiction of the Secretaries of the \nMilitary Departments (except those forces necessary to\ncarry out the functions of the Military Departments as\nnoted in Title 10, USC, Section 162) are assigned to\nCCMDs or Commander, United States Element, North \nAmerican Aerospace Defense Command, or designated \nas Service retained by SecDef in the GFMIG.  A force\nassigned or attached to a CCMD, or Service retained by\na Service Secretary, may be transferred from that\ncommand to another CCDR only when directed by \nSecDef and under procedures prescribed by SecDef and\napproved by the President. \nOther Authorities \nADCON is the direction or exercise of authority over \nsubordinate or other organizations with respect to\nadministration and support, including organization of \nService forces, control of resources and equipment,	Federation of American Scientists
america_doctrine_28	America		personnel management, logistics, individual and unit\ntraining, \nreadiness, \nmobilization, \ndemobilization,\ndiscipline, and other matters not included in the\noperational missions of the subordinate or other \norganizations.  Coordinating authority is the authority \ndelegated to a commander or individual for coordinating\nspecific functions and activities involving forces of two\nor more Military Departments, two or more joint force\ncomponents, or two or more forces of the same Service \n(e.g., joint security coordinator exercises coordinating\nauthority for joint security area operations among the\ncomponent commanders).  Direct liaison authorized is \nthat authority granted by a commander (any level) to a\n \nExecutive Summary \nxxiii \nsubordinate to directly consult or coordinate an action \nwith a command or agency within or outside of the\ngranting command. \nCommand of National Guard \nand Reserve Forces \nWhen mobilized under Title 10, USC, authority,\ncommand of National Guard and Reserve forces (except \nthose forces specifically exempted) is assigned by\nSecDef to the CCMDs.  Those forces are available for \noperational missions when mobilized for specific\nperiods in accordance with the law or when ordered to\nactive duty and after being validated for employment by \ntheir parent Service.  Normally, National Guard forces \nare under the commands of their respective governors in\nTitle 32, USC, or state active duty status. \nCommand and Control of  \nJoint Forces \nCommand is the most important role undertaken by a \nJFC.  C2 is the means by which a JFC synchronizes\nand/or integrates joint force activities.  C2 ties together \nall the operational functions and tasks and applies to all\nlevels of war and echelons of command. \nCommand and Control \nFundamentals \nC2 enhances the commander’s ability to make sound \nand timely decisions and successfully execute them.\nUnity of effort over complex operations is made\npossible through decentralized execution of centralized,\noverarching plans or via	Federation of American Scientists
america_doctrine_29	America		mission command.  Unity of\ncommand is strengthened through adherence to the \nfollowing C2 tenets: clearly defined authorities, roles,\nand relationships; mission command; information\nmanagement and knowledge sharing; communication;\ntimely decision making; coordination mechanisms;\nbattle rhythm discipline; responsive, dependable, and \ninteroperable support systems; situational awareness; \nand mutual trust. \nOrganization for Joint \nCommand and Control \nComponent and supporting commands’ organizations\nand capabilities must be integrated into a joint\norganization that enables effective and efficient joint\nC2.  The JFC should be guided in this effort by the\nfollowing principles: simplicity, span of control, unit\nintegrity, and interoperability. \nJoint Command and Staff \nProcess \nThe nature, scope, and tempo of military operations \ncontinually changes, requiring the commander to make\nnew decisions and take new actions in response to these\nchanges.  This may be viewed as part of a cycle, which\nis repeated when the situation changes significantly.\nExecutive Summary \nxxiv \nJP 1 \nAlthough the scope and details will vary with the level \nand function of the command, the purpose is constant:\nanalyze the situation and need for action; determine the\ncourse of action (COA) best suited for mission\naccomplishment; and carry out that COA, with\nadjustments as necessary, while continuing to assess the \nunfolding situation. \nCommand and Control  \nSupport \nA C2 support system, which includes interoperable\nsupporting communications systems, is the JFC’s\nprincipal tool used to collect, transport, process, share,\nand protect data and information.  To facilitate the \nexecution \nand \nprocesses \nof \nC2, \nmilitary\ncommunications systems must furnish rapid, reliable,\nand secure information throughout the chain of\ncommand. \nNational Military Command \nSystem \nThe National Military Command System provides the \nmeans by which the President and SecDef can receive\nwarning and intelligence so that	Federation of American Scientists
america_doctrine_30	America		accurate and timely\ndecisions can be made, the resources of the Military\nServices can be applied, military missions can be\nassigned, and direction can be communicated to CCDRs \nor the commanders of other commands. \nNuclear Command and Control \nSystem \nThe Nuclear Command and Control System supports \nthe Presidential nuclear C2 of the CCMDs in the areas \nof integrated tactical warning and attack assessment, \ndecision making, decision dissemination, and force\nmanagement and report back.   \nDefense Continuity Program \nThe Defense Continuity Program is an integrated \nprogram composed of DOD policies, plans, procedures,\nassets, and resources that ensures continuity of DOD \ncomponent mission-essential functions under all \ncircumstances, including crisis, attack, recovery, and\nreconstitution. \nJoint Force Development \nPrinciples of Joint Force \nDevelopment \nJoint force development entails the purposeful\npreparation of individual members of the Armed Forces \n(and the units that they comprise) to present a force\ncapable of executing assigned missions.  It includes joint\ndoctrine, joint education, joint training, joint lessons\nlearned, and joint concept development and assessment.\n \nExecutive Summary \nxxv \nAuthorities \nJoint force development involves synergistic execution\nof the legislated authorities of the CJCS, the Service\nChiefs, and others (such as CDRUSSOCOM).  US law\n(Title 10, USC, Section 153) gives the CJCS authority \nregarding \njoint \nforce \ndevelopment, \nspecifically \nproviding authority to develop doctrine for the joint\nemployment of the Armed Forces, and to formulate \npolicies for the joint training of the Armed Forces to \ninclude polices for the military education and training of\nmembers of the Armed Forces. \nJoint Force Development \nJoint force development is a knowledge-based \nenterprise.   A discussion of each of the force\ndevelopment subordinate processes follows.   \nJoint Doctrine \nJoint doctrine consists of the fundamental principles \nthat guide the	Federation of American Scientists
america_doctrine_31	America		employment of US military forces in \ncoordinated action toward a common objective.  It\nprovides the authoritative guidance from which joint\noperations are planned and executed.  \nJoint Education \nEducation is a key aspect of the joint force development \nprocess.  Joint education is the aspect of professional \nmilitary education that focuses on imparting joint\nknowledge and attitudes.  Joint education can be broadly\nparsed into three categories: joint professional military\neducation; enlisted joint professional military education; \nand other joint education. \nJoint Training \nJoint training prepares joint forces or joint staffs to \nrespond \nto \nstrategic, \noperational, \nor \ntactical\nrequirements considered necessary by the CCDRs to \nexecute their assigned or anticipated missions.  Joint \ntraining encompasses both joint training of individuals\nas well as collective training of joint staffs, units, and \nthe Service components of joint forces. \nLessons Learned \nThe joint lessons learned component of joint force \ndevelopment entails collecting observations, analyzing \nthem, and taking the necessary steps to turn them into\n“learned lessons”—changes in behavior that improve \nthe mission ready capabilities of the joint force.\nProperly assessed, these positive and negative\nobservations help senior leaders identify and fix \nproblems, reinforce success, and inside the joint force\nExecutive Summary \nxxvi \nJP 1 \ndevelopment perspective, adjust the azimuth and\ninteraction of the various lines of effort. \nJoint Concepts and Assessment Joint concepts examine military problems and propose \nsolutions describing how the joint force, using military\nart and science, may operate to achieve strategic goals\nwithin the context of the anticipated future security\nenvironment.  Joint concepts lead to military\ncapabilities, both non-materiel and materiel, that \nsignificantly improve the ability of the joint force to\novercome future challenges. A joint assessment is an \nanalytical activity based	Federation of American Scientists

Results of an\nassessment are reproducible and provide defensible\nanalytic evidence for joint force development decisions\nCONCLUSION \n \nThis publication is the capstone joint doctrine \npublication and provides doctrine for unified action by\nthe Armed Forces of the United States.  It specifies the\nauthorized command relationships and authority that\nmilitary commanders can use, provides guidance for the\nexercise of that military authority, provides fundamental \nprinciples and guidance for C2, prescribes guidance for\norganizing and developing joint forces, and describes\npolicy for selected joint activities.  It also provides the\ndoctrinal basis for interagency coordination and for US \nmilitary involvement in multiagency and multinational\noperations. \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI-1 \nCHAPTER I \nTHEORY AND FOUNDATIONS \nSECTION A.  THEORY \n1.  Fundamentals \na.  This publication provides overarching guidance and fundamental principles for the \nemployment of the Armed Forces of the United States.  It is the capstone publication of the \nUS joint doctrine hierarchy and it provides an overview for the development of other joint \nservice doctrine publications.  It is a bridge between policy and doctrine and describes \nauthorized command relationships and authority that military commanders use and other \noperational matters derived from Title 10, United States Code (USC).   \nb.  The purpose of joint doctrine is to enhance the operational effectiveness of joint \nforces by providing fundamental principles that guide the employment of US military \nforces toward a common objective.  With the exception of Joint Publication (JP) 1, joint \ndoctrine will not establish policy.  However, the use of joint doctrine standardizes \nterminology, training, relationships, responsibilities, and processes among all US forces to \nfree joint	Federation of American Scientists
america_doctrine_33	America		force commanders (JFCs) and their staffs to focus their efforts on solving \nstrategic, operational, and tactical problems.  Using historical analysis of the employment \nof the military instrument of national power in operations and contemporary lessons, these \nfundamental principles represent what is taught, believed, and advocated as what works \nbest to achieve national objectives.   \nc.  As a nation, the US wages war employing all instruments of national power—\ndiplomatic, informational, military, and economic.  The President employs the Armed \nForces of the United States to achieve national strategic objectives.  The Armed Forces of \nthe United States conduct military operations as a joint force.  “Joint” connotes activities  \nin which elements of two or more Military Departments participate.  Joint matters relate to \nthe integrated employment of US military forces in joint operations, including matters \nrelating to: \n(1)  National military strategy (NMS). \n(2)  Deliberate and crisis action planning. \n(3)  Command and control (C2) of joint operations. \n(4)  Unified action with Department of Defense (DOD) and interagency partners.  \nThe capacity of the Armed Forces of the United States to operate as a cohesive joint team \nis a key advantage in any operational environment.  Unity of effort facilitates decisive \n“Doctrine provides a military organization with a common philosophy, a common \nlanguage, a common purpose, and a unity of effort.” \nGeneral George H. Decker, US Army Chief of Staff, 1960-1962 \nChapter I \nI-2 \nJP 1 \nunified action focused on national objectives and leads to common solutions to national \nsecurity challenges. \nd.  Jointness and the Joint Force.  The Armed Forces of the United States have \nembraced “jointness” as their fundamental organizing construct at all echelons.  Jointness \nimplies cross-Service combination wherein the capability of the joint force is understood \nto be synergistic, with the sum greater than its parts (the capability of	Federation of American Scientists
america_doctrine_34	America		individual \ncomponents).  Some shared military activities are less joint than are “common;” in this \nusage “common” simply means mutual, shared, or overlapping capabilities or activities \nbetween two or more Services. \n(1)  Fundamentally, joint forces require high levels of interoperability and \nsystems that are conceptualized and designed with joint architectures and acquisition \nstrategies.  This level of interoperability reduces technical, doctrinal, and cultural barriers \nthat limit the ability of JFCs to achieve objectives.  The goal is to employ joint forces \neffectively across the range of military operations (ROMO). \n(2)  All Service components contribute their distinct capabilities to the joint force; \nhowever, their interdependence is critical to overall joint effectiveness.  Joint \ninterdependence is the purposeful reliance by one Service on another Service’s capabilities \nto maximize complementary and reinforcing effects of both (i.e., synergy), the degree of \ninterdependence varying with specific circumstances. \n(3)  The synergy that results from the operations of joint forces maximizes the \ncapability of the force.  The JFC has the operational authority and responsibility to tailor \nforces for the mission at hand, selecting those that most effectively and efficiently ensure \nsuccess. \n(4)  The joint force is a values based organization.  The character, professionalism \nand values of our military leaders have proven to be vital for operational success.  See \nAppendix B, “Character, Professionalism, and Values,” for an expanded discussion of \nvalues. \nFor a more detailed explanation of the ROMO, see paragraph 9, “Instruments of National \nPower and the Range of Military Operations.” \n2.  War \na.  War can result from failure of states to resolve their disputes by diplomatic means.  \nSome philosophers see it as an extension of human nature.  Thomas Hobbes stated that \nman’s nature leads him to fight for personal gain, safety, or reputation.  Thucydides said	Federation of American Scientists
america_doctrine_35	America		nearly the same thing in a different order, citing fear, honor, and interest as the common \ncauses for interstate conflict. \nb.  Individuals, groups, organizations, cultures, and nations all have interests.  \nInevitably, some of those interests conflict with the interests of other individuals, groups, \norganizations, cultures, and nations.  Nearly all international and interpersonal \nrelationships are based on power and self-interests manifested through politics.  Nations \n \nTheory and Foundations \nI-3 \nexercise their power through diplomatic, informational, military, and economic means.  All \nforms of statecraft are important, but as the conflicts approach the requirement for the use \nof force to achieve that nation’s interests, military means become predominant and war can \nresult.  The emergence of non-state actors has not changed this concept.  Non-state actors \nmay not use statecraft as established; however, they do coerce and threaten the diplomatic \npower of other nations and have used force, terrorism, or support to insurgency to compel \na government to act or refrain from acting in a particular situation or manner or to change \nthe government’s policies or organization. \nc.  War is socially sanctioned violence to achieve a political purpose.  War historically \ninvolves nine principles, collectively and classically known as the principles of war (see \nFigure I-1).  The basic nature of war is immutable, although warfare evolves constantly. \nThe application of these classic principles in the conduct of joint operations is amplified \nand expanded in JP 3-0, Joint Operations. \nd.  As an integral aspect of human culture, war has been defined and discussed in \nmyriad contexts.  As an element of statecraft, it has groundings in US and international law \nand treaty.  Classic scholars such as Carl von Clausewitz and Sun Tzu provide valuable \nperspectives necessary to inform a more complete understanding of the nature of war. \ne.  Clausewitz believed that war is a	Federation of American Scientists
america_doctrine_36	America		subset of the larger theory of conflict.  He defined \nwar as a “duel on a larger scale,” “an act of force to compel our enemy,” and a “continuation \nof politics by other means.”  Distilled to its essence, war is a violent struggle between two \n(or more) hostile and independent wills, each trying to impose itself on the other.  As \nClausewitz states, “war is a violent clash of wills.” \n(1)  Clausewitz believed that war is characterized by the shifting interplay of a \ntrinity of forces—emotion (irrational), chance (nonrational), and reason (rational)—\nconnected by principal actors that comprise a social trinity of the people, the military \nforces, and the government. \n(2)  Clausewitz noted that the conduct of war combines friction, chance, and \nuncertainty.  These variables often combine to cause “the fog of war.”  These observations \nremain true today and place a burden on the commander to remain responsive, versatile, \nand adaptive in real time to create and seize opportunities and reduce vulnerabilities. \n \nFigure I-1.  Principles of War \nPrinciples of War\n\n\n\n\n\nObjective\nOffensive\nMass\nEconomy of force\nManeuver\n\n\n\n\nUnity of command\nSecurity\nSurprise\nSimplicity\nChapter I \nI-4 \nJP 1 \nf.  According to Sun Tzu, war is “a matter vital to the state; the province of life or \ndeath; the road to survival or ruin.”  To assess its essentials, he suggests that one analyze \nit in terms of five fundamental factors: moral influence, weather, terrain, command, and \ndoctrine.  He further posits that “what is of supreme importance in war is to attack the \nenemy’s strategy.” \ng.  Strategy in War.  The two fundamental strategies in the use of military force are \nstrategy of annihilation and strategy of erosion. \n(1)  The first is to make the enemy helpless to resist us, by physically destroying \nhis military capabilities.  This has historically been characterized as annihilation or \nattrition. It requires the enemy’s incapacitation as a viable military force.  We may use	Federation of American Scientists
america_doctrine_37	America		force when we seek a political objective, such as the overthrow of the enemy leaders.  We \nmay also use this strategy in pursuit of more limited political objectives, if we believe the \nenemy will continue to resist as long as means to do so remain. \n(2)  The second approach is to convince the enemy that accepting our terms will \nbe less painful than continuing to aggress or resist.  This can be characterized as erosion, \nusing military force to erode the enemy leadership’s or the enemy society’s political will.  \nIn such an approach, we use military force to raise the costs of resistance higher than the \nenemy is willing to pay.  We use force in this manner in pursuit of limited political goals \nthat we believe the enemy leadership will ultimately be willing to accept. \n(3)  Particularly at the higher levels, waging war should involve the use of all \ninstruments of national power that one group can bring to bear against another (diplomatic, \ninformational, military, and economic).  While the military focuses on the use of military \nforce, we must not consider it in isolation from the other instruments of national power.  \nParagraph 9, “Instruments of National Power and the Range of Military Operations,” \ndiscusses the instruments of national power. \n3.  Warfare \nWarfare is the mechanism, method, or modality of armed conflict against an enemy.  \nIt is “the how” of waging war.  Warfare continues to change and be transformed by society, \ndiplomacy, politics, and technology. \na.  Historian John Keegan offers that war is a universal phenomenon whose form and \nscope is defined by the society that wages it.  The changing form and scope of warfare \ngives value to delineating the distinction between war and warfare. \nb.  Understanding the changing nature of warfare frames the context in which wars are \nfought.  Context helps combatants make informed choices as to such essential matters as \nforce structure, force preparation, the conduct of campaigns and operations, and	Federation of American Scientists
america_doctrine_38	America		rules of \nengagement (ROE). \nc.  The US military recognizes two basic forms of warfare—traditional and irregular.  \nThe delineating purpose of each is the strategic focal point of each form.  As war is a \nduality, warfare generally has both traditional and irregular dimensions and offensive and \n \nTheory and Foundations \nI-5 \ndefensive  aspects.  The forms of warfare are applied not in terms of an “either/or” choice, \nbut in various combinations to suit a combatant’s strategy and capabilities. \n4.  Forms of Warfare \na.  Overview.  A useful dichotomy for thinking about warfare is the distinction \nbetween traditional and irregular warfare (IW).  Each serves a fundamentally different \nstrategic purpose that drives different approaches to its conduct; this said, one should not \nlose sight of the fact that the conduct of actual warfare is seldom divided neatly into these \nsubjective categories.  Warfare is a unified whole, incorporating all of its aspects together, \ntraditional and irregular.  It is, in fact, the creative, dynamic, and synergistic combination \nof both that is usually most effective. \n \n \nb.  Traditional Warfare.  This form of warfare is characterized as a violent struggle \nfor domination between nation-states or coalitions and alliances of nation-states.  This form \nis labeled as traditional because it has been the preeminent form of warfare in the West \nsince the Peace of Westphalia (1648) that reserved for the nation-state alone a monopoly \non the legitimate use of force.  The strategic purpose of traditional warfare is the imposition \nof a nation’s will on its adversary nation-state(s) and the avoidance of its will being \nimposed upon us. \n(1)  In the traditional warfare model, nation-states fight each other for reasons as \nvaried as the full array of their national interests.  Military operations in traditional warfare \nnormally focus on an adversary’s armed forces to ultimately influence the adversary’s \ngovernment.  With the increasingly rare case	Federation of American Scientists
america_doctrine_39	America		of formally declared war, traditional warfare \ntypically involves force-on-force military operations in which adversaries employ a variety \nof conventional forces and special operations forces (SOF) against each other in all \nphysical domains as well as the information environment (which includes cyberspace). \n(2)  Typical mechanisms for victory in traditional warfare include the defeat of an \nadversary’s armed forces, the destruction of an adversary’s war-making capacity, and/or \nthe seizure or retention of territory.  Traditional warfare is characterized by a series of \noffensive, defensive, and stability operations normally conducted against enemy centers of \ngravity.  Traditional warfare focuses on maneuver and firepower to achieve operational \nand ultimately strategic objectives. \nNote: It is recognized that the symmetry between the naming \nconventions of traditional and irregular warfare is not ideal.  Several \nsymmetrical pair sets—regular/irregular, traditional/nontraditional (or \nuntraditional), and conventional/unconventional—were considered and \ndiscarded.  Generating friction in the first two instances was the fact that \nmost US operations since the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks have \nbeen irregular; this caused the problem of calling irregular or \nnontraditional what we do routinely.  In the last instance, \nconventional/unconventional had previous connotation and wide usage \nthat could not be practically overcome. \nChapter I \nI-6 \nJP 1 \n(3)  Traditional warfare generally assumes that the majority of  people indigenous \nto the operational area are not belligerents and will be subject to whatever political outcome \nis imposed, arbitrated, or negotiated.  A fundamental military objective is to minimize \ncivilian interference in military operations. \n(4)  The traditional warfare model also encompasses non-state actors who adopt \nconventional military capabilities and methods in service of traditional warfare victory \nmechanisms. \n(5)  The near-term	Federation of American Scientists
america_doctrine_40	America		results of traditional warfare are often evident, with the conflict \nending in victory for one side and defeat for the other or in stalemate. \nc.  Irregular Warfare.  This form of warfare is characterized as a violent struggle \namong state and non-state actors for legitimacy and influence over the relevant \npopulation(s).  This form is labeled as irregular in order to highlight its non-Westphalian \ncontext.  The strategic point of IW is to gain or maintain control or influence over, and the \nsupport of, a relevant population. \n(1)  IW emerged as a major and pervasive form of warfare although it is not a \nhistorical form of warfare.  In IW, a less powerful adversary seeks to disrupt or negate the \nmilitary capabilities and advantages of a more powerful military force, which usually \nserves that nation’s established government.  The less powerful adversaries, who can be \nstate or non-state actors, often favor indirect and asymmetric approaches, though they may \nemploy the full range of military and other capabilities in order to erode their opponent’s \npower, influence, and will.  Diplomatic, informational, and economic methods may also be \nemployed.  The weaker opponent could avoid engaging the superior military forces entirely \nby attacking nonmilitary targets in order to influence or control the local populace.  \nIrregular forces, to include partisan and resistance fighters in opposition to occupying \nconventional military forces, are included in the IW formulation.  Resistance and partisan \nforces, a form of insurgency, conduct IW against conventional occupying powers.  They \nuse the same tactics as described above for the weaker opponent against a superior military \nforce to increase their legitimacy and influence over the relevant populations. \n(2)  Military operations alone rarely resolve IW conflicts.  For the US, which will \nalways wage IW from the perspective of a nation-state, whole-of-nation approaches where \nthe military instrument of power sets	Federation of American Scientists
america_doctrine_41	America		conditions for victory are essential.  Adversaries \nwaging IW have critical vulnerabilities to be exploited within their interconnected political, \nmilitary, economic, social, information, and infrastructure systems. \n(3)  An enemy using irregular methods will typically endeavor to wage protracted \nconflicts in an attempt to exhaust the will of their opponent and its population.  Irregular \nthreats typically manifest as one or a combination of several forms including insurgency, \nterrorism, disinformation, propaganda, and organized criminal activity based on the \nobjectives specified (such as drug trafficking and kidnapping).  Some will possess a range \nof sophisticated weapons, C2 systems, and support networks that are typically \ncharacteristic of a traditional military force.  Both sophisticated and less sophisticated \n \nTheory and Foundations \nI-7 \nirregular threats will usually have the advantages derived from knowledge of the local area \nand ability to blend in with the local population. \nd.  To address these forms of warfare, joint doctrine is principally based on a \ncombination of offensive, defensive, and stability operations.  The predominant method or \ncombination depends on a variety of factors, such as capabilities and the nature of the \nenemy. \n5.  Levels of Warfare \na.  General.  While the various forms and methods of warfare are ultimately expressed \nin concrete military action, the three levels of warfare—strategic, operational, and \ntactical—link tactical actions to achievement of national objectives (see Figure I-2).  There \nare no finite limits or boundaries between these levels, but they help commanders design \nand synchronize operations, allocate resources, and assign tasks to the appropriate \ncommand.  The strategic, operational, or tactical purpose of employment depends on the \nnature of the objective, mission, or task. \nb.  Strategic Level.  Strategy is a prudent idea or set of ideas for employing the \ninstruments of national power in a	Federation of American Scientists
america_doctrine_42	America		synchronized and integrated fashion to achieve theater \nand multinational objectives.  At the strategic level, a nation often determines the national \n(or multinational in the case of an alliance or coalition) guidance that addresses strategic \nobjectives in support of strategic end states and develops and uses national resources to \nFigure I-2.  Levels of Warfare \nLevels of Warfare\nStrategic Level\nOperational Level\nTactical Level\nNational Policy\nCampaigns\nBattles\nTheater Strategy\nMajor Operations\nEngagements\nSmall-Unit and Crew Actions\nChapter I \nI-8 \nJP 1 \nachieve them.  The President, aided by the National Security Council (NSC) and Homeland \nSecurity Council (HSC) as the National Security Staff, establishes policy and national \nstrategic objectives.  The day-to-day work of the NSC and HSC is accomplished by the \ncombined National Security Staff, the President’s principal staff for national security \nissues.  The Secretary of Defense (SecDef) translates these into strategic military objectives \nthat facilitate identification of the military end state and theater strategic planning by the \ncombatant commanders (CCDRs).  CCDRs usually participate in strategic discussions with \nthe President and SecDef through the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS) and \nwith partner nations.  The CCDR’s strategy is an element that relates to both US national \nstrategy and operational-level activities within the theater. \nc.  Operational Level.  The operational level links strategy and tactics by establishing \noperational objectives needed to achieve the military end states and strategic objectives.  It \nsequences tactical actions to achieve objectives.  The focus at this level is on the planning \nand execution of operations using operational art:  the cognitive approach by commanders \nand staffs—supported by their skill, knowledge, experience, creativity, and judgment—to \ndevelop strategies, campaigns, and operations to organize and employ military forces by \nintegrating	Federation of American Scientists
america_doctrine_43	America		ends, ways, and means.  JFCs and component commanders use operational art \nto determine when, where, and for what purpose major forces will be employed and to \ninfluence the adversary’s disposition before combat.  Operational art governs the \ndeployment of those forces and the arrangement of battles and major operations to achieve \noperational and strategic objectives. \nd.  Tactical Level.  Tactics is the employment and ordered arrangement of forces in \nrelation to each other.  The tactical level of war is where battles and engagements are \nplanned and executed to achieve military objectives assigned to tactical units or joint task \nforces (JTFs).  Activities at this level focus on the ordered arrangement and maneuver of \ncombat elements in relation to each other and enemy to achieve combat objectives.  An \nengagement can include a wide variety of activities between opposing forces normally in \na short-duration action.  A battle consists of a set of related engagements involving larger \nforces than used in engagements and normally affect the course of an operation or a \ncampaign.  Forces at the tactical level generally employ various tactics to achieve their \nmilitary objectives. \ne.  While the traditional separate levels of war, as shown in Figure I-2, may help \ncommanders visualize a logical arrangement of missions, allocate resources, and assign \ntasks to the appropriate command, campaigns and major operations then provide the \nframework within which the joint force accomplishes the mission; the actual execution is \nmore complicated.  With today’s constant 24-hour media coverage and easy access to the \nInternet by our enemies for propaganda, a tactical-level plan and resulting action can have \nsevere operational or strategic implications.  For example, an action by one Soldier, \nMarine, Sailor, or Airman on the battlefield at the tactical level could potentially cause \nsignificant disruption to operational and strategic-level planning.  Conversely, operations \nat	Federation of American Scientists
america_doctrine_44	America		all levels can be positively influenced by pervasive media coverage, which must be \nincorporated in plans at all levels.  In this sense, during execution all three levels overlap.  \nCommanders and their staffs at all levels must anticipate how their plans, operations, and \nactions may impact the other levels (those above and those below). \n \nTheory and Foundations \nI-9 \n6.  Campaigns and Operations \na.  Tactics, techniques, and procedures are the fundamental building blocks of concrete \nmilitary activity.  Broadly, actions generate effects; they change in the environment or \nsituation.  Tactical actions are the component pieces of operations. \nb.  An operation is a sequence of tactical actions with a common purpose or unifying \ntheme.  An operation may entail the process of carrying on combat, including movement, \nsupply, attack, defense, and maneuvers needed to achieve the objective of any battle or \ncampaign.  However, an operation need not involve combat.  A major operation is a series \nof tactical actions, such as battles, engagements, and strikes, conducted by combat forces \ncoordinated in time and place, to achieve strategic or operational objectives in an \noperational area. \nc.  A campaign is a series of related major operations aimed at achieving strategic and \noperational objectives within a given time and space.  Planning for a campaign is \nappropriate when contemplated military operations exceed the scope of a single major \noperation.  Thus, campaigns are often the most extensive joint operations in terms of time \nand other resources.  Some operations can be executed in a single operation and not require \ncampaigning.  A noncombatant evacuation, for example, may be executed in a single \noperation. \n7.  Task, Function, and Mission \n It is worthwhile to discuss three key terms, task, function, and mission, which are \nrelevant to the conduct of warfare at all levels.   \na.  A task is a clearly defined action or activity assigned to an individual or	Federation of American Scientists
america_doctrine_45	America		organization.  It is a specific assignment that must be done as it is imposed by an \nappropriate authority.  Function and mission implicitly involve things to be done, or tasks.  \nIt is, however, important to delineate between an organization’s function and its mission. \nb.  A function is the broad, general, and enduring role for which an organization is \ndesigned, equipped, and trained.  Organizationally, functions may be expressed as a task, \na series of tasks, or in more general terms.  Broadly, a function is the purpose for which an \norganization is formed.  In the context of employing a joint force, joint functions are seven \nbasic groups of related capabilities and activities—C2, intelligence, fires, movement and \nmaneuver, protection, sustainment, and information—that help JFCs integrate, \nsynchronize, and direct joint operations. \nc.  Mission entails the task, together with the purpose, that clearly indicates the action \nto be taken and the reason therefore.  A mission always consists of five parts:  the who \n(organization to act), what (the task to be accomplished and actions to be taken), when \n(time to accomplish the task), where (the location to accomplish the task), and why (the \npurpose the task is to support).  Higher headquarters commanders typically assign a \nmission or tasks to their subordinate commanders, who convert these to a specific mission \nstatement through mission analysis.  A mission is what an organization is directed to do.  \nChapter I \nI-10 \nJP 1 \nFunctions are the purposes for which an organization is formed.  The two are symbiotic.  \nTasks are relevant to both functions and missions. \nFor more information on the functions of DOD, refer to Chapter III, “Functions of the \nDepartment of Defense and Its Major Components.”  For more information on joint \nfunctions, refer to JP 3-0, Joint Operations. \nSECTION B.  FOUNDATIONS \n \n8.  Strategic Security Environment and National Security Challenges \na.  The strategic security environment is	Federation of American Scientists
america_doctrine_46	America		characterized by uncertainty, complexity, \nrapid change, and persistent conflict.  This environment is fluid, with continually changing \nalliances, partnerships, and new national and transnational threats constantly appearing and \ndisappearing.  While it is impossible to predict precisely how challenges will emerge and \nwhat form they might take, we can expect that uncertainty, ambiguity, and surprise will \ndominate the course of regional and global events.  In addition to traditional conflicts to \ninclude emerging peer competitors, significant and emerging challenges continue to \ninclude irregular threats, adversary propaganda, and other information activities directly \ntargeting our civilian leadership and population, catastrophic terrorism employing weapons \nof mass destruction (WMD), and other threats to disrupt our ability to project power and \nmaintain its qualitative edge. \nb.  The strategic security environment presents broad national security challenges \nlikely to require the employment of joint forces in the future.  They are the natural products \nof the enduring human condition, but they will exhibit new features in the future.  All of \nthese challenges are national problems calling for the application of all the instruments of \nnational power.  The US military will undertake the following activities to deal with these \nchallenges:  \n(1)  Secure the Homeland.  Securing the US homeland is the Nation’s first \npriority.  The US homeland is continuously exposed to the possibility of harm from hostile \nstates, groups, and individuals.  The Nation must be vigilant and guard against such threats.  \nDefense of the homeland is DOD’s highest priority with the goal to identify and defeat \nthreats as far away from the homeland as possible.  Deterrence and security cooperation \nare relevant to homeland defense (HD) and qualify as distinct security challenges. \n“Pure military skill is not enough.  A full spectrum of military, para-military, and \ncivil action must be	Federation of American Scientists
america_doctrine_47	America		blended to produce success.  The enemy uses economic \nand political warfare, propaganda, and naked military aggression in an endless \ncombination to oppose a free choice of government and suppress the rights of \nthe individual by terror, by subversion, and by force of arms.  To win in this \nstruggle, our officers and [Service] men must understand and combine the \npolitical, economic, and civil actions with skilled military efforts in the execution \nof the mission.” \nPresident John F. Kennedy \nLetter to the United States Army, 11 April 1962 \n \nTheory and Foundations \nI-11 \n(2)  Win the Nation’s Wars.  Deterring our adversaries is a US goal.  Winning \nthe Nation’s wars remains the preeminent justification for maintaining capable and credible \nmilitary forces in the event that deterrence should fail.  In the future, as in the past, war and \nwarfare may take a variety of forms.  It may erupt among or between states or non-state \nentities with war-making capabilities.  It may manifest as traditional warfare or IW.  When \nthe US commits military forces into conflict, success is expected. \n(3)  Deter Our Adversaries.  Defending national interests requires being able to \nprevail in conflict and taking preventive measures to deter potential adversaries who could \nthreaten the vital interests of the US or its partners.  These threats could range from direct \naggression to belligerent actions that nonetheless threaten vital national interests.  \nDeterrence influences potential adversaries not to take threatening actions.  It requires \nconvincing those adversaries that a contemplated action will not achieve the desired result \nby fear of the consequences.  Deterrence is a state of mind brought about by the existence \nof a credible threat of unacceptable counteraction.  Because of the gravity of potential \nnuclear aggression by a growing list of actors, maintaining a credible nuclear deterrent \ncapability will remain a critical national security imperative. \n(4)  Security	Federation of American Scientists
america_doctrine_48	America		Cooperation.  Security cooperation encompasses all DOD \ninteractions with foreign defense establishments to build defense relationships that promote \nspecific US security interests, develop allied and friendly military capabilities for self- \ndefense and multinational operations, and provide US forces with peacetime and \ncontingency access to a host nation (HN).  Establishing, maintaining, and enhancing \nsecurity cooperation among our partner nations is important to strengthen the global \nsecurity framework of the US and its partners.  Security cooperation allows us to \nproactively take advantage of opportunities and not just react to threats.  Contributing to \nsecurity cooperation activities is a large part of what the US military does and will continue \nto do.  Supporting security cooperation activities is an essential element of the CCDR’s \nday-to-day work to enhance regional security and thereby advance national interests.  Like \ndeterrence, security cooperation activities can reduce the chances of conflict, but unlike \ndeterrence, it does not involve the threat of force.  Security cooperation and deterrence \nshould be complementary as both contribute to security and prevent conflict. \n(5)  Support to Civil Authorities.  The US will continue to respond to a variety \nof civil crises to relieve human suffering and restore civil functioning, most often in support \nof civil authorities.  These crises may be foreign or domestic and may occur independently, \nas in a natural disaster disrupting an otherwise functioning society, or they may occur \nwithin the context of a conflict, such as widespread suffering in a nation embroiled in an \ninsurgency. \n(6)  Adapt to Changing Environment.  The strategic security environment and \nnational security challenges are always changing.  The ability to address the changing \nenvironment and meet our security challenges falls to the instruments of national power \nand the ability of the Armed Forces of the United States to conduct	Federation of American Scientists
america_doctrine_49	America		military operations \nworldwide. \nChapter I \nI-12 \nJP 1 \n9.  Instruments of National Power and the Range of Military Operations \na.  The ability of the US to advance its national interests is dependent on the \neffectiveness of the United States Government (USG) in employing the instruments of \nnational power to achieve national strategic objectives.  The appropriate governmental \nofficials, often with NSC direction, normally coordinate the employment of instruments of \nnational power. \n(1)  Diplomatic.  Diplomacy is the principal instrument for engaging with other \nstates and foreign groups to advance US values, interests, and objectives, and to solicit \nforeign support for US military operations.  Diplomacy is a principal means of organizing \ncoalitions and alliances, which may include states and non-state entities, as partners, allies, \nsurrogates, and/or proxies.  The Department of State (DOS) is the USG lead agency for \nforeign affairs.  The credible threat of force reinforces, and in some cases, enables the \ndiplomatic process.  Geographic combatant commanders (GCCs) are responsible for \naligning military activities with diplomatic activities in their assigned areas of \nresponsibility (AORs).  The chief of mission, normally the US ambassador, and the \ncorresponding country team are normally in charge of diplomatic-military activities in a \ncountry abroad.  In these circumstances, the chief of mission and the country team or \nanother diplomatic mission team may have complementary activities (employing the \ndiplomatic instrument) that do not entail control of military forces, which remain under \ncommand authority of the GCC.   \n(2)  Informational.  Information remains an important instrument of national \npower and a strategic resource critical to national security.  Previously considered in the \ncontext of traditional nation-states, the concept of information as an instrument of national \npower extends to non-state actors—such as terrorists and transnational	Federation of American Scientists
america_doctrine_50	America		criminal groups—\nthat are using information to further their causes and undermine those of the USG and our \nallies.  DOD operates in a dynamic age of interconnected global networks and evolving \nsocial media platforms.  Every DOD action that is planned or executed, word that is written \nor spoken, and image that is displayed or relayed, communicates the intent of DOD, and \nby extension the USG, with the resulting potential for strategic effects.  \n(a)  DOD makes every effort to synchronize, align, and coordinate \ncommunication activities to facilitate an understanding of how the planning and execution \nof DOD strategies, plans, operations, and activities will be received or understood by key \naudiences.  This effort is undertaken to improve the efficacy of these actions and create, \nstrengthen, or preserve conditions favorable to advancing defense and military objectives.  \nCommunication synchronization entails focused efforts to create, strengthen, or preserve \nconditions favorable for the advancement of national interests, policies, and objectives by \nunderstanding and engaging key audiences through the use of coordinated programs, plans, \nthemes, messages, and products synchronized with the actions of all instruments of national \npower.  In support of these efforts, commanders and staffs at all levels should identify and \nunderstand key audience perceptions and possible reactions when planning and executing \noperations.  This understanding of key audience perceptions and reactions is a vital element \nof every theater campaign and contingency plan.  Real or perceived differences between \nactions and words (the “say-do” gap) are addressed and actively mitigated as appropriate, \n \nTheory and Foundations \nI-13 \nsince this divergence can directly contribute to reduced credibility and have a negative \nimpact on the ability to successfully execute current and future missions.  Attention paid \nto commander’s communication guidance during planning and execution improves	Federation of American Scientists
america_doctrine_51	America		the \nalignment of multiple lines of operation and lines of effort over time and space, which \naligns the overarching message with our actions and activities. \n(b)  Commander’s communication guidance is a fundamental component of \nnational strategic direction.  It also is essential to our ability to achieve unity of effort \nthrough unified action with our interagency partners and the broader interorganizational \ncommunity.  Fundamental to this effort is the premise that key audience beliefs, \nperceptions, and behavior are crucial to the success of any strategy, plan, and operation.  \nThrough commander’s communication synchronization (CCS), public affairs (PA), \ninformation operations (IO), and defense support to public diplomacy are realized as \ncommunication supporting capabilities.  Leaders, planners, and operators at all levels need \nto understand the desired effects and anticipate potential undesired effects of our actions \nand words, identify key audiences, and when appropriate, actively address their \nperspectives.  Inconsistencies between what US forces say and do can reduce DOD \ncredibility and negatively affect current and future missions.  An effective combination of \nthemes, messages, images, and actions, consistent with higher-level guidance, is essential \nto effective DOD operations. \n(c)  Within DOD, JFCs implement higher-level communication guidance \nthrough the CCS process.  JFCs provide guidance and their staffs develop the approach for \nachieving information-related objectives and ensuring the integrity and consistency of \nthemes, messages, images, and actions to the lowest level through the integration and \nsynchronization of relevant information-related capabilities.  Considering the messages our \nwords, images, and actions communicate is integral to military planning and operations \nand should be coordinated and synchronized with DOD’s interorganizational partners. \nSee JP 3-0, Joint Operations, and JP 5-0, Joint Operation Planning, for more	Federation of American Scientists
america_doctrine_52	America		information \non commander’s communication guidance implementation. \n(3)  Military.  The US employs the military instrument of national power at home \nand abroad in support of its national security goals.  The ultimate purpose of the US Armed \nForces is to fight and win the Nation’s wars.  Fundamentally, the military instrument is \ncoercive in nature, to include the integral aspect of military capability that opposes external \ncoercion.  Coercion generates effects through the application of force (to include the threat \nof force) to compel an adversary or prevent our being compelled.  The military has various \ncapabilities that are useful in non-conflict situations (such as in foreign relief).  Regardless \nof when or where employed, the Armed Forces of the United States abide by US values, \nconstitutional principles, and standards for the profession of arms. \n(4)  Economic.  A strong US economy with free access to global markets and \nresources is a fundamental engine of the general welfare, the enabler of a strong national \ndefense.  In the international arena, the Department of the Treasury works with other USG \nagencies, the governments of other nations, and the international financial institutions to \nChapter I \nI-14 \nJP 1 \nencourage economic growth, raise standards of living, and predict and prevent, to the extent \npossible, economic and financial crises. \nb.  The routine interaction of the instruments of national power is fundamental to US \nactivities in the strategic security environment.  The military instrument’s role increases \nrelative to the other instruments as the need to compel a potential adversary through force \nincreases.  The USG’s ability to achieve its national strategic objectives depends on \nemploying the instruments of national power discussed herein in effective combinations \nand all possible situations from peace to war. \nc.  At the President’s direction through the interagency process, military power is \nintegrated with other instruments of	Federation of American Scientists
america_doctrine_53	America		national power to advance and defend US values, \ninterests, and objectives.  To accomplish this integration, the Armed Forces interact with \nthe other departments and agencies to develop a mutual understanding of the capabilities, \nlimitations, and consequences of military and civilian actions.  They also identify the ways \nin which military and nonmilitary capabilities best complement each other.  The NSC plays \nkey roles in the integration of all instruments of national power, facilitating Presidential \ndirection, cooperation, and unity of effort (unified action). \nd.  Political and military leaders must consider the employment of military force in \noperations characterized by a complex, interconnected, and global operational environment \nthat affect the employment of capabilities and bear on the decisions of the commander.  \nThe addition of military force to coerce an adversary should be carefully integrated with \nthe other instruments of national power to achieve our objectives. \ne.  The military instrument of national power can be used in a wide variety of ways \nthat vary in purpose, scale, risk, and combat intensity.  These various ways can be \nunderstood to occur across a continuum of conflict ranging from peace to war.  Inside this \ncontinuum, it is useful from a strategic perspective to delineate the use of the military \nFigure I-3.  Range of Military Operations \nRange of Military Operations\nMajor Operations and Campaigns\nMilitary Engagement, Security Cooperation, and Deterrence\nCrisis Response and Limited Contingency Operations\nRange of \nMilitary \nOperations\nOur national leaders can use the military instrument of national power across the conflict \ncontinuum in a wide variety of operations that are commonly characterized in three groups as \nthis figure depicts.\nPeace\nConflict Continuum\nWar\n \nTheory and Foundations \nI-15 \ninstrument of national power into three broad categories.  Mindful that the operational level \nof warfare connects the tactical to the	Federation of American Scientists
america_doctrine_54	America		strategic, and operations and campaigns are \nthemselves scalable, the US uses the construct of the ROMO to provide insight into the \nvarious broad usages of military power from a strategic perspective.  See Figure I-3 for \nthese three broad categories, noting that the delineations between the categories are not \nprecise, as each application of military power has unique contextual elements.  Each \ncategory will be discussed in turn. \n(1)  Military Engagement, Security Cooperation, and Deterrence.  These \nongoing activities establish, shape, maintain, and refine relations with other nations.  Many \nof these activities occur across the conflict continuum, and will usually continue in areas \noutside the operational areas associated with ongoing limited contingency operations, \nmajor operations, and campaigns. \n(a)  Military engagement is the routine contact and interaction between \nindividuals or elements of the Armed Forces of the United States and those of another \nnation’s armed forces, domestic or foreign civilian authorities or agencies to build trust and \nconfidence, share information, and coordinate mutual activities. \n(b)  Security cooperation involves all DOD interactions with foreign defense \nestablishments to build defense relationships that promote specific US security interests, \ndevelop allied and friendly military capabilities for self-defense and multinational \noperations, and provide US forces with peacetime and contingency access to an HN.  This \nincludes activities such as security assistance.  Security cooperation is a key element of \nglobal and theater shaping operations. \n(c)  Deterrence helps prevent adversary action through the presentation of a \ncredible threat of counteraction.  As discussed previously, deterrence convinces adversaries \nnot to take threatening actions by influencing their decision making. \n(d)  Military actions such as nation assistance (e.g., foreign internal defense, \nsecurity assistance, humanitarian and civic assistance),	Federation of American Scientists
america_doctrine_55	America		counterinsurgency, DOD support \nto counterdrug operations, show of force operations, and combating WMD activities are \napplied to meet military engagement, security cooperation, and deterrence objectives. \n(2)  Crisis Response and Limited Contingency Operations.  A crisis response \nor limited contingency operation can be a single small-scale, limited-duration operation or \na significant part of a major operation of extended duration involving combat.  The \nassociated general strategic and operational objectives are to protect US interests and \nprevent surprise attack or further conflict.  Included are operations to ensure the safety of \nNote:  Some specific crisis response or limited contingency operations \nmay not involve large-scale combat, but could be considered major \noperations/campaigns depending on their scale and duration (e.g., \nOperation UNIFIED ASSISTANCE tsunami and Hurricane Katrina relief \nefforts in 2005, Operation TOMODACHI Japanese tsunami and nuclear \nrelief efforts in 2011). \nChapter I \nI-16 \nJP 1 \nAmerican citizens and US interests while maintaining and improving US ability to operate \nwith multinational partners to deter the hostile ambitions of potential aggressors (e.g., \nOperation SHINING EXPRESS in 2003; United States European Command [USEUCOM] \nlaunched a joint operation that rescued US citizens and embassy personnel from Monrovia \nand supported African peacekeeping forces during the Liberian civil war).  Many such \noperations involve a combination of military forces and capabilities in close cooperation \nwith interorganizational partners. \n(3)  Major Operations and Campaigns.  When required to achieve national \nstrategic objectives or protect national interests, the US national leadership may decide to \nconduct a major operation or campaign involving large-scale combat.  In such cases, the \ngeneral goal is to prevail against the enemy as quickly as possible, conclude hostilities, and \nestablish conditions favorable to the US and its	Federation of American Scientists
america_doctrine_56	America		interorganizational partners.  Major \noperations and campaigns feature a balance among offensive, defensive, and stability \noperations through six phases: shape, deter, seize initiative, dominate, stabilize, and enable \ncivil authority.  The immediate goal of stability operations often is to provide the local \npopulace with security, restore essential services, and meet humanitarian needs.  The long- \nterm goal may be to develop the following:  indigenous capacity for securing essential \nservices, a viable market economy, rule of law, democratic institutions, and a robust civil \nsociety.  Major operations and campaigns typically are composed of multiple phases.  \n10.  Joint Operations \na.  In the context of the military instrument of national power, operations are military \nactions or the carrying out of a strategic, operational, tactical, service, training, or \nadministrative military missions.  Operations include combat when necessary to achieve \nobjectives at all levels of war.  Although individual Services may plan and conduct \noperations to accomplish tasks and missions in support of DOD objectives, the primary \nway DOD employs two or more Services (from two Military Departments) in a single \noperation, particularly in combat, is through joint operations. \nb.  Joint operations is the general term to describe military actions conducted by joint \nforces and those Service forces in specified command relationships with each other.  A \njoint force is one composed of significant elements, assigned or attached, of two or more \nMilitary Departments operating under a single JFC. \nc.  The extensive capabilities available to forces in joint operations enable them to \naccomplish tasks and missions across the conflict continuum in operations that can range \nfrom routine military engagement commonly associated with peacetime to large-scale \ncombat required to fight and win our Nation’s wars.  In conjunction with these two \nextremes, military forces can provide security in a	Federation of American Scientists
america_doctrine_57	America		wide variety of circumstances and can \nhelp other partners restore essential civil services through relief and reconstruction in the \nwake of combat, breakdown of civil order, or natural disaster.  These four broad areas, \noften integrated and adapted to the commander’s requirements in a joint operation, \nrepresent the military instrument’s contribution to meeting our Nation’s challenges in the \nstrategic security environment. \n \nTheory and Foundations \nI-17 \n(1)  The scope and nature of military engagement activities can vary, reflecting \ndiffering strategic relationships between the US and partner nations.  Engagement includes \nstability operations and other missions, tasks, and actions that improve the capabilities of, \nor cooperation with, allies and other partners.  It is the primary military contribution to the \nnational challenge of establishing cooperative security.  Military engagement may be \nconducted complementary to broader diplomatic or economic activities, to aid a \ngovernment’s own security activities, and even during war itself.  However, commanders \nand staff must be aware of myriad laws and regulations governing everything from limits \non funding and the deployment of military personnel to legislative restrictions on the tasks \nto which military assistance may be applied.  Thus close and continuous coordination \nbetween the military and other departments and agencies is essential. \n(2)  Our Nation may resort to combat when diplomacy or deterrence fails.  The \nfundamental purpose of combat is to defeat armed enemies during traditional warfare, IW, \nor a combination.  It concludes when the mission is accomplished.  Combat includes the \ncombination of offensive and defensive operations and missions to achieve objectives.  \nCombat missions can vary in scale from individual strikes to extensive campaigns and can \nemploy the full range of capabilities available to the military instrument of national power. \n(3)  Military forces are also adept at	Federation of American Scientists
america_doctrine_58	America		providing security in a wide range of \ncircumstances.  Security missions and tasks cover stability operations, civil support, and \nother requirements to protect and control civil populations and territory, whether friendly, \nhostile, or neutral.  They also include inherent offensive and defensive measures to protect \nthe joint force.  Security actions ultimately seek to reassure rather than compel.  Effective \nsecurity requires a visible and enduring presence.  Joint forces can improve security \nthrough security force assistance, which enhances the capabilities and capacities of a \npartner nation or regional security organization through training, equipment, advice, and \nassistance. \n(4)  A fourth broad area, relief and reconstruction, includes stability operations, \ncivil support, and other missions and tasks that restore essential civil services in the wake \nof combat, a breakdown of civil order, or a natural disaster.  The military provides support \nto DOS to assist its relief and reconstruction efforts.  Relief and reconstruction assistance \nmay be required in a wide range of situations, such as military occupation, \ncounterinsurgency, and humanitarian crises.  Such assistance may be required whether or \nnot civilian relief assets are present and may involve significant civilian contractor support. \n11.  Joint Functions \na.  There are significant complexities to effectively integrating and synchronizing \nService and combat support agency (CSA) capabilities in joint operations.  These \nchallenges are not new, and they present themselves with consistency.  For example, \nsimply getting the joint force to form and deploy in a coherent and desired manner requires \nintegration of organization, planning, and communication capabilities and activities.  But \nto fully employ the joint force in extensive and complex operations requires a much greater \narray of capabilities and procedures to help the commander and staff integrate and \nsynchronize the joint force’s actions.	Federation of American Scientists
america_doctrine_59	America		These types of activities and capabilities center on \nChapter I \nI-18 \nJP 1 \nthe commander’s ability to employ the joint force and are grouped under one functional \narea called command and control.  In a similar manner, many other functionally related \ncapabilities and activities can be grouped.  These groupings, we call joint functions, \nfacilitate planning and employment of the joint force. \nb.  In addition to command and control, the joint functions include intelligence, fires, \nmovement and maneuver, protection, sustainment, and information.  Some functions, \nsuch as command and control, intelligence, and information apply to all operations.  Others, \nsuch as fires, apply as the mission requires.  A number of subordinate tasks, missions, and \nrelated capabilities help define each function, and some apply to more than one joint \nfunction.  Balancing their complementary but competing processes and capabilities is \ncentral to leadership and command of joint operations. \nc.  The commander must exercise all the joint functions to effectively operate the force \nand generate combat power.  Inadequate integration and balancing of these functions can \nundermine the cohesion, effectiveness, and adaptability of the force.  For example, \ninattention to protection can deplete combat power unnecessarily, thereby undermining \nreserves and degrading the force’s ability to capitalize on an opportunity or respond to an \nunforeseen problem.  Likewise, inattention to intelligence can leave the force with \ninadequate information to support decision making or identify opportunities in time to \nexploit them.  Each of the joint functions is discussed below. \n(1)  Command and control encompasses the exercise of authority, responsibility, \nand direction by a commander over assigned and attached forces to accomplish the mission. \nCommand at all levels is the art of motivating and directing people and organizations into \naction to accomplish missions.  Control is inherent in command.  To	Federation of American Scientists
america_doctrine_60	America		control is to manage \nand direct forces and functions consistent with a commander’s command authority.  \nControl of forces and functions helps commanders and staffs compute requirements, \nallocate means, and integrate efforts.  Mission command is the preferred method of \nexercising C2.  A complete discussion of tenets, organization, and processes for effective \nC2 is provided in Section B, “Command and Control of Joint Forces,” of Chapter V “Joint \nCommand and Control.” \n(2)  Intelligence helps commanders and staffs understand the operational \nenvironment and achieve information superiority.  Intelligence identifies enemy \ncapabilities and vulnerabilities, projects probable intentions and actions, and is a critical \naspect of the joint planning process and execution of operations.  It provides assessments \nthat help the commander decide which forces to deploy; when, how, and where to deploy \nthem; and how to employ them in a manner that accomplishes the mission. \n(3)  Fires.  To employ fires is to use available weapons and other systems to create \na specific lethal or nonlethal effect on a target.  Joint fires are those delivered during the \nemployment of forces from two or more components in coordinated action to produce \ndesired results in support of a common objective.  Fires typically produce destructive \neffects, but some ways and means, such as electronic attack and other nonlethal \ncapabilities, can be employed with little or no associated physical destruction. \n \nTheory and Foundations \nI-19 \n(4)  Movement and maneuver encompasses the disposition of joint forces to \nconduct operations by securing positional advantages before or during execution.  This \nfunction includes moving or deploying forces into an operational area and maneuvering \nthem within the timeline and to the operational depth necessary to achieve objectives.  It \nuses organic and supporting means and methods that allow a commander to choose where \nand when to engage an adversary or take best	Federation of American Scientists
america_doctrine_61	America		advantage of geographic and environmental \nconditions. \n(5)  The protection function focuses on conserving the joint force’s fighting \npotential through active defensive measures that protect the joint force from an adversary’s \nattack; passive defensive measures that make friendly forces, systems, and facilities \ndifficult to locate, strike, and destroy; technology and procedures that reduce the risk of \nfratricide; and emergency management and response to reduce the loss of personnel and \ncapabilities due to accidents, health threats, and natural disasters.  When directed, the JFC’s \nmission for protection may extend beyond force protection to encompass protection of US \ncivilians; the forces, systems, and civil infrastructure of friendly nations; and our \ninterorganizational partners. \n(6)  Sustainment is the provision of logistics and personnel services necessary to \nmaintain and prolong operations until mission accomplishment.  Sustainment provides the \nJFC flexibility, endurance, and the ability to extend operational reach.  Effective \nsustainment determines the depth to which the joint force can conduct decisive operations, \nallowing the JFC to seize, retain, and exploit the initiative. \n(7)  The information function encompasses the management and application of \ninformation and its deliberate integration with other joint functions to influence relevant-\nactor perceptions, behavior, action or inaction, and supports human and automated decision \nmaking.  The information function helps commanders and staffs understand and leverage \nthe pervasive nature of information, its military uses, and its application during all military \noperations.  This function provides JFCs the ability to integrate the generation and \npreservation of friendly information while leveraging the inherent informational aspects of \nall military activities to achieve the commander’s objectives and attain the end state. \nd.  Joint functions should be balanced and integrated with due	Federation of American Scientists
america_doctrine_62	America		consideration of \ncompeting resources, multiple versus single support capabilities, shifting operational \npriorities, and differences among Service component practices. \nFor a more detailed discussion of joint functions, refer to JP 3-0, Joint Operations. \n12.  Joint Operation Planning \na.  Joint operation planning is the way the military links and transforms national \nstrategic objectives into tactical actions.  It ties the military instrument of national power \nto the achievement of national security goals and objectives and is essential in promoting \nand securing desired global strategic end states during peacetime and war.  Planning begins \nwith the end state in mind, providing a unifying purpose around which actions and \nresources are focused. \nChapter I \nI-20 \nJP 1 \nb.  Joint operation planning provides a common basis for discussion, understanding, \nand change for the joint force, its subordinate and higher headquarters, the joint planning \nand execution community (JPEC), and the national leadership.  In accordance with the \nGuidance for Employment of the Force (GEF), adaptive planning supports the transition \nof DOD planning from a contingency-centric approach to a strategy-centric approach.  The \nAdaptive Planning and Execution (APEX) system facilitates iterative dialogue and \ncollaborative planning between the multiple echelons of command.  The APEX system \nensures that the military instrument of national power is employed in accordance with \nnational priorities and policy.  It also guarantees the plans are rapidly updated and adapted \nas the situation requires according to changes in policy, strategic guidance, resources, \nand/or the operational environment.  Joint operation planning also identifies capabilities \noutside of DOD required for accomplishment of strategic end states and objectives and \nprovides a forum for interagency dialogue, coordination, and action. \nc.  The pursuit and attainment of the US national strategic objectives in today’s \ncomplex	Federation of American Scientists
america_doctrine_63	America		environment requires critical and creative thinking about the challenges facing \nthe joint force.  Joint operation planning fosters understanding, allowing commanders and \nstaff to clearly understand the operational environment and identify the problem(s) and \nproblem framework to enable further detailed planning.  The planning process, both \niterative and collaborative, facilitates the development of options to effectively meet the \ncomplex challenges facing joint forces throughout the world. \nd.  The body of information and understanding created during planning allows CCDRs \nand their subordinate JFCs and their staffs to adapt to uncertain and changing environments \nand to anticipate and rapidly act in crisis situations.  Joint operation planning produces \nmultiple options to employ the US military and to integrate US military actions with other \ninstruments of US national power in time, space, and purpose to achieve global strategic \nend states.  Planning also identifies and aligns resources with military actions, providing a \nframework to identify and mitigate risk.  The CCDRs’ participation in the Joint Strategic \nPlanning System (JSPS) and APEX system helps to ensure that warfighting and peacetime \noperational concerns are emphasized in all planning documents. \ne.  Joint operation planning is fundamental to assessing risk and identifying mitigation \nstrategies.  In the course of developing multiple options to meet strategic and military end \nstates and objectives, JFCs and their planning staffs, as well as the larger JPEC, identify \nand communicate shortfalls in DOD’s ability to resource, execute, and sustain the military \noperations contained in the plan as well as the necessary actions to reduce or mitigate risk.  \nJFCs communicate risk to senior leadership.  Risk is rarely eliminated, but through \nplanning, preparation, and constant assessment, risk can be mitigated and managed. \nf.  Joint operation planning and planning for a campaign are not separate	Federation of American Scientists
america_doctrine_64	America		planning \ntypes or processes.  Joint operation planning encompasses planning for any type of joint \noperation, such as small-scale, short-duration strike or raid; an operation that typically does \nnot involve combat such as nation assistance; and large-scale, long-duration campaigns.  \nFunctional components (air, land, maritime, and special operations [SO]), Service \ncomponents, and CSAs do not plan campaigns, but instead plan and conduct subordinate \nand supporting operations to campaign plans. \n \nTheory and Foundations \nI-21 \ng.  Joint operation planning requires the support of a wide array of staff expertise \n(personnel, intelligence, operations, logistics, communications, etc.) to provide JFCs with \na thoughtful and coordinated product.  Joint operation planning should be synchronized \nwith national planning, so that interagency inputs are used in conjunction with military \nplans to reach strategic and military end states. \nFor more information, refer to JP 5-0, Joint Operation Planning; JP 1-0, Joint Personnel \nSupport; JP 2-0, Joint Intelligence; JP 3-0, Joint Operations; JP 4-0, Joint Logistics; and \nJP 6-0, Joint Communications System. \n13.  Law of War \nIt is DOD policy that the Armed Forces of the United States will adhere to the law of \nwar, often called the law of armed conflict, during all military operations.  The law of war \nis the body of law that regulates both the legal and customary justifications for utilizing \nforce and the conduct of armed hostilities; it is binding on the US and its individual citizens.  \nIt includes treaties and international agreements to which the US is a party, as well as \napplicable customary international law.  It specifically applies to all cases of declared war \nor any other armed conflict involving the US; by policy, the principles and spirit of the law \nof war apply to all other military operations short of armed conflict.  CCDRs must be \nparticularly aware of the status of any conflict and the characterization of	Federation of American Scientists
america_doctrine_65	America		adversarial \ncombatants and noncombatants (e.g., medical and chaplain personnel). \nFor further guidance on the law of war, refer to Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff \nInstruction (CJCSI) 5810.01, Implementation of the DOD Law of War Program, and JP 1-\n04, Legal Support to Military Operations. \n \n \nChapter I \nI-22 \nJP 1 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIntentionally Blank \n \nII-1 \nCHAPTER II \nDOCTRINE GOVERNING UNIFIED DIRECTION OF ARMED FORCES \n1.  National Strategic Direction \na.  National strategic direction is governed by the Constitution, US law, USG policy \nregarding internationally recognized law, and the national interest as represented by \nnational security policy.  This direction leads to unified action which results in unity of \neffort to achieve national goals.  At the strategic level, unity of effort requires coordination \namong government departments and agencies within the executive branch, between the \nexecutive and legislative branches, with nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), \nintergovernmental organizations (IGOs), the private sector, and among nations in alliance \nor coalition, and during bilateral or multilateral engagement.  National policy and planning \ndocuments generally provide national strategic direction.  The President and SecDef, \nthrough CJCS, provide direction for Service Chiefs, Military Department Secretaries, \nCCDRs, and CSA directors to: \n(1)  Provide clearly defined and achievable national strategic objectives. \n(2)  Provide timely strategic direction. \n(3)  Prepare Active Component (AC) and Reserve Component (RC) forces for \ncombat. \n(4)  Focus DOD intelligence systems and efforts on the operational environment. \n(5)  Integrate DOD, partner nations, and/or other government departments and \nagencies into planning and subsequent operations.   \n(6)  Maintain all required support assets in a high state of readiness. \n(7)  Deploy forces and sustaining capabilities that are ready to support the JFC’s \nconcept of	Federation of American Scientists
america_doctrine_66	America		operations (CONOPS). \nRefer to JP 3-0, Joint Operations, and JP 5-0, Joint Operation Planning, for more \ninformation on specific policy and planning documents related to national strategic \ndirection. \nb.  Responsibilities for national strategic direction as established by the \nConstitution and US law and practice are as follows: \n“An army is a collection of armed men obliged to obey one man.  Every change \nin the rules which impairs the principle weakens the army.” \nWilliam T. Sherman \nGeneral of the Army, 1879 \nChapter II \nII-2 \nJP 1 \n(1)  The President of the United States is responsible to the American people \nfor national strategic direction.   \n(a)  When the US undertakes military operations, the Armed Forces of the \nUnited States are only one component of a national-level effort involving all instruments \nof national power.  Instilling unity of effort at the national level is necessarily a cooperative \nendeavor involving a number of USG departments and agencies.  In certain operations, \nagencies of states, localities, or foreign countries may also be involved.  The President \nestablishes guidelines for civil-military integration and disseminates decisions and \nmonitors execution through the NSC. \n(b)  Complex operations may require a high order of civil-military \nintegration.  Presidential directives guide participation by all US civilian and military \nagencies in such operations.  Military leaders should work with the members of the national \nsecurity team in the most skilled, tactful, and persistent ways to promote unity of effort.  \nOperations of departments or agencies representing the diplomatic, economic, and \ninformational instruments of national power are not under command of the Armed Forces \nof the United States or of any specific JFC.  In US domestic situations, another department \nsuch as the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) may assume overall control of \ninteragency coordination including military elements.  Abroad, the chief of mission,	Federation of American Scientists
america_doctrine_67	America		supported by the country team, is normally in control. \n(2)  SecDef is responsible to the President for creating, supporting, and employing \nmilitary capabilities.  SecDef is the link between the President and the CCDRs, and \nprovides direction and control of the CCDRs as they conduct military activities and \noperations. SecDef provides authoritative direction and control over the Services through \nthe Secretaries of the Military Departments.  SecDef exercises control of and authority over \nthose forces not specifically assigned to the combatant commands (CCMDs) and \nadministers this authority through the Military Departments, the Service Chiefs, and \napplicable chains of command.  The Secretaries of the Military Departments organize, \ntrain, and equip forces and provide for the administration and support of forces within their \ndepartment, including those assigned or attached to the CCDRs. \n(3)  The CJCS is the principal military advisor to the President, the NSC, and \nSecDef and functions under the authority, direction, and control of the President and \nSecDef.  The CJCS assists the President and SecDef in providing for the strategic direction \nof the Armed Forces.  Communications between the President or SecDef and the CCDRs \nare normally transmitted through the CJCS. \n(4)  CCDRs exercise combatant command (command authority) (COCOM) over \nassigned forces and are responsible to the President and SecDef for the preparedness of \ntheir commands and performance of assigned missions.  GCCs have responsibility for a \ngeographic AOR assigned through the Unified Command Plan (UCP).  The UCP \nestablishes CCMD missions and responsibilities, delineates the general geographical AOR \nfor GCCs, and provides the framework used to assign forces.  Functional combatant \ncommanders (FCCs) have transregional responsibilities for assigned functions and support \n \nDoctrine Governing Unified Direction of Armed Forces \nII-3 \n(or can be supported by) GCCs or may conduct missions assigned	Federation of American Scientists
america_doctrine_68	America		by the UCP \nindependently. \n(5)  The Chief, National Guard Bureau (CNGB), is a principal advisor to SecDef \nthrough the CJCS on matters involving non-federalized National Guard forces and through \nother DOD officials as determined by SecDef.  In domestic US situations, National Guard \nforces are a unique multi-status component with roles and responsibilities defined by \nfederal and state law. \n(6)  In a foreign country, the US chief of mission is responsible to the President \nfor directing, coordinating, and supervising all USG elements in the HN, except those \nunder the command of a CCDR.  GCCs are responsible for coordinating with chiefs of \nmission in their geographic AOR (as necessary) and for negotiating memoranda of \nagreement (MOAs) with the chiefs of mission in designated countries to support military \noperations.  Force protection is an example of a military operation/requirement where an \nMOA would enhance coordination and integration. \n2.  Strategic Guidance and Responsibilities \na.  Military Planning.  Military planning consists of joint strategic planning with its \nthree subsets: security cooperation planning, force planning, and joint operation \nplanning.  Regarding force planning for the future, DOD conducts capabilities-based \nplanning (CBP).  The essence of CBP is to identify capabilities that adversaries could \nemploy against the US or a multinational opponent and to defend themselves; identify \ncapabilities, US and multinational, that could be available to the joint or combined force to \ncounter/defeat the adversary; and then identify and evaluate possible outcomes (voids or \nopportunities), rather than forecasting (allocating) forces against specific threat scenarios.  \nIntegral to a capabilities-based approach are joint capability areas (JCAs), DOD’s \ncapability management language and framework.  JCAs are collections of like DOD \ncapabilities functionally grouped to support capability analysis, strategy development, \ninvestment, decision	Federation of American Scientists
america_doctrine_69	America		making, capability portfolio management, and capabilities-based \nforce development.  They link the strategies for developing, managing, and employing the \nforce by providing an organizing construct that facilitates collaboration among the many \nrelated DOD activities and processes.  As the specific capabilities for given JCAs mature, \nthey are vetted and verified through best practices based on extant capabilities and, when \nappropriate, incorporated into joint doctrine. \nb.  National Planning Documents \n(1)  The national security strategy (NSS), signed by the President, addresses the \ntasks that, as a Nation, are necessary to provide enduring security for the American people \nand shape the global environment.  It provides a broad strategic context for employing \nmilitary capabilities in concert with other instruments of national power.  In the ends, ways, \nand means construct, the NSS provides the ends. \n(2)  The national defense strategy (NDS), signed by SecDef, outlines DOD’s \napproach to implementing the President’s NSS.  The NDS supports the NSS by establishing \nChapter II \nII-4 \nJP 1 \na set of overarching defense objectives that guide DOD’s security activities and provide \ndirection for the NMS.  The NDS objectives serve as links between military activities and \nthose of other USG departments and agencies in pursuit of national goals.   This document \nprovides the ways in the ends, ways, and means construct. \n(3)  The NMS, signed by CJCS, supports the aims of the NSS and implements the \nNDS.  It describes the Armed Forces’ plan to achieve military objectives in the near term \nand provides a vision for maintaining a force capable of meeting future challenges.  It also \nprovides focus for military activities by defining a set of interrelated military objectives \nand joint operating concepts from which the CCDRs and Service Chiefs identify desired \ncapabilities and against which the CJCS assesses risk.  This provides the final piece of the \nends, ways, and means	Federation of American Scientists
america_doctrine_70	America		construct—the means. \n(4)  Guidance for Employment of the Force.  The GEF merges Contingency \nPlanning Guidance and Security Cooperation Guidance into one document that provides \ncomprehensive, near-term planning guidance.  The GEF provides Presidential and SecDef \npolitico-military guidance.  The President approves the contingency planning guidance \ncontained in the GEF and approves SecDef’s issuance of the GEF.  The GEF is guided by \nthe UCP and NDS and forms the basis for strategic policy guidance, campaign plans, and \nthe Joint Strategic Capabilities Plan (JSCP). \n(5)  Joint Strategic Capabilities Plan.  The JSCP provides guidance to CCDRs, \nService Chiefs, CSA directors, applicable DOD agencies, DOD field activity directors, and \nthe CNGB to accomplish tasks and missions based on near-term military capabilities.  The \nJSCP is signed by the CJCS and implements campaign, contingency, and posture planning \nguidance reflected in the GEF. \n(6)  Further, the GEF and JSCP provide CCDRs with specific planning guidance \nfor preparation of their theater campaign plans (TCPs), global campaign plans (GCPs), \nsubordinate campaign plans, and contingency plans.  Figure II-1 illustrates the various \nstrategic guidance sources described below in the context of national strategic direction. \n(7)  The National Strategy for Homeland Security, also signed by the President, \nprovides national direction to secure the homeland through a comprehensive framework \nfor organizing the efforts of federal, state, local, tribal, and private organizations whose \nprimary functions are often unrelated to national security. \n(8)  The National Response Framework developed by DHS establishes a \ncomprehensive, national-level, all-hazards, all-discipline approach to domestic incident \nmanagement.  It covers the full range of complex and constantly changing requirements in \nanticipation of, or in response to, threats or acts of terrorism, major disasters, and other \nemergencies.  DOD develops or	Federation of American Scientists

A \nTCP operationalizes CCDR functional and theater strategies.  Campaign plans focus on the \ncommand’s steady-state (Phase 0) activities, which include ongoing operations, security \ncooperation, and other shaping or preventive activities for the next 5 years.  It should \ninclude measurable and achievable objectives that contribute to the strategic end states in \nthe GEF.  Contingency plans for responding to crisis scenarios should be treated as branch \nplans to the campaign plan.  For planning purposes, GCCs use assigned forces, those \nrotationally deployed into the AOR, and those forces that historically have been deployed \nfor engagement activities.  Each GCC’s TCP and FCC’s GCP are sent to CJCS for review \nand integration into the global family of TCPs.  \n(b)  Campaign Support Plans.  Supporting CCMDs, Services, and DOD \nagencies routinely conduct security cooperation activities within a GCC’s AOR or \ninvolving foreign nationals from countries within an AOR.  Services and select DOD \nagencies will coordinate and provide their security cooperation strategies to the supported \nGCC. \n1.  Campaign support plans will balance competing CCMD demands for \nlimited global resources. \n2.  Campaign support plans or their update memoranda are submitted to \nthe CJCS and Under Secretary of Defense for Policy for review annually and are shared \nwith the GCCs. \nc.  Role of the Geographic Combatant Commanders \n(1)  GCCs are the vital link between those who determine national security policy \nand strategy and the military forces or subordinate JFCs that conduct military operations \nwithin their AORs.  GCCs are responsible for a large geographical area and	Federation of American Scientists
america_doctrine_73	America		for effective \ncoordination of operations within that area.  Directives flow from the President and SecDef \nthrough CJCS to the GCCs, who plan and conduct the operations that achieve national or \nmultinational strategic objectives.  GCCs provide guidance and direction through strategic \nestimates, command strategies, and plans and orders for the employment of military force.  \nAs military force may not achieve national objectives, it must be coordinated, \nsynchronized, and if appropriate, integrated with other USG departments and agencies, \nIGOs, NGOs, multinational forces (MNFs), and elements of the private sector. \n(2)  Using their strategic estimate(s) and strategic options, GCCs develop \nstrategies that translate national and multinational direction into strategic concepts or \ncourses of action (COAs) to meet strategic and joint operation planning requirements.  \nGCCs’ plans provide strategic direction; assign missions, tasks, forces, and resources; \ndesignate objectives; provide authoritative direction; promulgate ROE and rules for the use \nof force (RUF); establish constraints and restraints (military limitations); and define \npolicies and CONOPS to be integrated into subordinate or supporting plans.  GCCs also \nexercise directive authority for logistics over assigned forces and authority for force \nprotection over all DOD personnel (including their dependents) assigned, attached, \n \nDoctrine Governing Unified Direction of Armed Forces \nII-7 \ntransiting through, or training in the GCC’s AOR.  The exception is for those for whom a \nchief of mission retains security responsibility. \nd.  Functional Combatant Commanders.  FCCs provide support to and may be \nsupported by GCCs and other FCCs as directed by higher authority.  FCCs are responsible \nfor a large functional area requiring single responsibility for effective coordination of the \noperations therein.  These responsibilities are normally global in nature.  The President and \nSecDef direct what specific	Federation of American Scientists
america_doctrine_74	America		support and to whom such support will be provided.  When an \nFCC is the supported commander and operating within GCCs’ AORs, close coordination \nand communication between them is paramount. \ne.  Service Chiefs and Commander, United States Special Operations Command \n(CDRUSSOCOM).  The Service Chiefs and CDRUSSOCOM (in areas unique to SO) \nunder authority established in Title 10, USC, among other tasks, organize, train, and equip \nAC and RC forces, DOD civilian personnel, contractor personnel, and selected HN \npersonnel.  The AC and RC are fully integrated partners in executing US military strategy, \nto include HD and defense support of civil authorities (DSCA) operations.  The RC \nprovides operational capabilities and strategic depth to meet US requirements worldwide.  \nThe RC provides operational forces that can be used on a regular basis while maintaining \nstrategic depth in the event of mid- to large-scale contingencies or other unanticipated \nnational crises.  Unpredictable crises call for trained and ready forces that are either forward \ndeployed or are rapidly and globally deployable.  These forces should be initially self-\nsufficient and must possess the capabilities needed to effectively act in the US national \ninterest or signal US resolve prior to conflict.  Such forces are usually drawn from the \nactive force structure and normally are tailored and integrated into joint organizations \nthat capitalize on the unique and complementary capabilities of the Services and United \nStates Special Operations Command (USSOCOM).   \nf.  United States Coast Guard (USCG).  The Commandant of the Coast Guard is \nresponsible for organizing, training, and equipping Service forces under Titles 10 and 14, \nUSC.  The Commandant may provide forces to GCCs to perform activities for which those \nforces are uniquely suited.  Under Title 14, USC, the USCG is assigned to DHS for \nhomeland security (HS).  In addition, the Commandant is responsible for the coordination \nand conduct of	Federation of American Scientists
america_doctrine_75	America		maritime law enforcement and security operations under civil authorities \nfor HS in the US maritime domain.  DOD forces may act in direct support of USCG \ncommanders.  The USCG has authority to make inquiries, examinations, inspections, \nsearches, seizures, and arrests upon the high seas and waters over which the US has \njurisdiction.  It is the only military Service not constrained by the Posse Comitatus Act or \nits extension by DOD directive. \ng.  DOD Agencies.  DOD agencies are organizations established by SecDef under \nTitle 10, USC, to perform a supply or service activity common to more than one Military \nDepartment.  There are 16 DOD agencies including Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), \nDefense Logistics Agency (DLA), Missile Defense Agency, and Defense Threat Reduction \nAgency (DTRA), among others. \nChapter II \nII-8 \nJP 1 \n3.  Unified Action \na.  Unified action synchronizes, coordinates, and/or integrates joint, single-Service, \nand multinational operations with the operations of other USG departments and agencies, \nNGOs, IGOs (e.g., the United Nations [UN]), and the private sector to achieve unity of \neffort (see Figure II-2).  Unity of command within the military instrument of national \npower supports the national strategic direction through close coordination with the other \ninstruments of national power. \nb.  Success often depends on unified actions.  The CJCS and all CCDRs are in \npivotal positions to facilitate the planning and conduct of unified actions in accordance \nwith the guidance and direction received from the President and SecDef in coordination \nwith other authorities (i.e., multinational leadership). \nc.  Unity of command in the Armed Forces of the United States starts with national \nstrategic direction.  For US military operations, unity of command is accomplished by \nestablishing a joint force, assigning a mission or objective(s) to the designated JFC, \nestablishing command relationships, assigning and/or attaching appropriate forces to	Federation of American Scientists

Roles and Functions \nThe terms “roles and functions” should not be used interchangeably, as the distinctions \nbetween them are important.   \na.  Roles are the broad and enduring purposes for which the Services and the CCMDs \nwere established in law.   \nb.  Functions are the appropriate assigned duties, responsibilities, missions, or tasks of \nan individual, office, or organization.  As defined in the National Security Act of 1947, as \namended, the term “function” includes functions, powers, and duties (Title 50, USC, \nSection 410[a]). \nFor further information on functions, refer to Chapter I, “Theory and Foundations,” \nParagraph 7, “Task, Function, and Mission,” and “Chapter III, “Functions of the \nDepartment of Defense and Its Major Components.” \n5.  Chain of Command \nThe President and SecDef exercise authority, direction, and control of the Armed \nForces through two distinct branches of the chain of C2 (see Figure II-3).  One branch runs \nfrom the President, through SecDef, to the CCDRs for missions and forces assigned to their \ncommands.  For purposes other than the operational direction	Federation of American Scientists
america_doctrine_77	America		of the CCMDs, the chain of \ncommand runs from the President to SecDef to the Secretaries of the Military Departments \nand, as prescribed by the Secretaries, to the commanders of Military Service forces.   The \nMilitary Departments, organized separately, operate under the authority, direction, and \ncontrol of the Secretary of that Military Department.  The Secretaries of the Military \nDepartments may exercise administrative control (ADCON) over Service forces through \ntheir respective Service Chiefs and Service commanders.  The Service Chiefs, except as \notherwise prescribed by law, perform their duties under the authority, direction, and control \nof the Secretaries of the respective Military Departments to whom they are directly \nresponsible.  \na. The CCDRs exercise COCOM over assigned forces and are directly responsible to \nthe President and SecDef for the performance of assigned missions and the preparedness \nof their commands.  CCDRs prescribe the chain of command within their CCMDs and \ndesignate the appropriate command authority to be exercised by subordinate commanders. \nb.  The Secretaries of the Military Departments operate under the authority, direction, \nand control of SecDef.  This branch of the chain of command is responsible for ADCON \nover all military forces within the respective Service not assigned to CCDRs (i.e., those \ndefined in the Global Force Management Implementation Guidance [GFMIG] as \n“unassigned forces”).  This branch is separate and distinct from the branch of the chain of \ncommand that exists within a CCMD. \nChapter II \nII-10 \nJP 1 \n \n \nFigure II-3.

Unified Command Plan \na.  The President, through the UCP, establishes CCMDs.  Commanders of unified \nCCMDs may establish subordinate unified commands when so authorized by SecDef.  \nSecDef, CCDR, a subordinate unified commander, or an existing JTF commander may \nestablish JTFs.  \nb.  CCDRs have responsibility for an AOR or a function (e.g., SO) assigned through \nthe UCP.  FCCs support (or can be supported by) GCCs or may conduct assigned missions \nin accordance with the UCP independently. \nc.  The Armed Forces of the United States are most effective when employed as a joint \nforce.  This “comprehensive approach” involving all participating organizations, both \nmilitary and nonmilitary, within an operational area requires the JFC to understand the \ncapabilities, limitations, and mandates of those organizations involved and to effectively \ncommunicate the mission of the joint force.  The basic doctrinal foundations for joint \nfunctions at all levels are outlined in this chapter. \n7.  Combatant Commands \na.  The President, through SecDef and with the advice and assistance of the CJCS, \nestablishes combatant (unified) commands for the performance of military missions and \nprescribes the force structure of such commands. \nb.  The CJCS assists the President and SecDef in performing their command functions.  \nThe CJCS transmits to the	Federation of American Scientists
america_doctrine_160	America		may be exercised. \n10.  Command of National Guard and Reserve Forces \na.  When mobilized under Title 10, USC, authority, command of National Guard and \nReserve forces (except those forces specifically exempted) is assigned by SecDef to the \nCCMDs.  Those forces are available for operational missions when mobilized for specific \nperiods  or when ordered to active duty after being validated for employment by their parent \nService.  Normally, National Guard forces are under the commands of their respective \ngovernors in Title 32, USC, or state active duty status.  \nb.  The authority CCDRs may exercise over assigned RC forces when not on active \nduty or when on active duty for training is TRO.  CCDRs normally will exercise TRO over \nassigned forces through Service component commanders.  TRO includes authority to: \n(1)  Provide guidance to Service component commanders on operational \nrequirements and priorities to be addressed in Military Department training and readiness \nprograms; \n(2)  Comment on Service component program recommendations and budget \nrequests; \n(3)  Coordinate and approve participation by assigned RC forces in joint exercises \nand training when on active duty for training or performing inactive duty for training; \n(4)  Obtain and review readiness and inspection reports on assigned RC forces; \nand \n(5)  Coordinate and review mobilization plans (including post-mobilization \ntraining and deployability validation) developed for assigned RC forces. \nc.  Unless otherwise directed by SecDef, the following applies: \n(1)  Assigned RC forces on active duty (other than for training) may not be \ndeployed until validated by the parent Service for deployment. \n(2)  CDRs may employ RC forces assigned to subordinate component \ncommanders in contingency operations when forces have been mobilized for specific \nperiods or when ordered to active duty after being validated for employment by their parent \nService.   \nChapter V \nV-14 \nJP 1 \n(3)  RC forces on active duty for	Federation of American Scientists
america_doctrine_79	America		commanders of the CCMDs the orders given by the President \nor SecDef and, as directed by SecDef, oversees the activities of those commands.  Orders \nissued by the President or SecDef normally are conveyed by the CJCS under the authority \nand direction of SecDef.  Reports from CCDRs normally will be submitted through CJCS, \nwho forwards them to SecDef and acts as the spokesman for the commanders of the \nCCMDs. \nc.  CCDRs exercise COCOM of assigned forces.  The CCDR may delegate operational \ncontrol (OPCON), tactical control (TACON), or establish support command relationships \nof assigned forces.  Unless otherwise directed by the President or SecDef, COCOM may \nnot be delegated.  During deliberate planning, generic forces are apportioned to specific \nplans according to Global Force Management procedures.  This requires supported CCDRs \nto coordinate with the supporting CCDRs and Services on required capabilities during \nplanning and on mission criteria for specific units once they have been allocated. \n8.  Military Departments, Services, Forces, Combat Support Agencies, and National \nGuard Bureau \na.  The authority vested in the Secretaries of the Military Departments in the \nperformance of their role to organize, train, equip, and provide forces runs from the \nPresident through SecDef to the Secretaries.  Then, to the degree established by the \nSecretaries or specified in law, this authority runs through the Service Chiefs to the Service \ncomponent commanders assigned to the CCDRs and to the commanders of forces not \nChapter II \nII-12 \nJP 1 \nassigned to the CCDRs.  ADCON provides for the preparation of military forces and their \nadministration and support, unless such responsibilities are specifically assigned by SecDef \nto another DOD component. \nb.  The Secretaries of the Military Departments are responsible for the administration \nand support of Service forces.  They fulfill their responsibilities by exercising ADCON \nthrough the Service Chiefs.  Service Chiefs	Federation of American Scientists
america_doctrine_80	America		have ADCON for all forces of their Service. \nThe responsibilities and authority exercised by the Secretaries of the Military Departments \nare subject by law to the authority provided to the CCDRs in their exercise of COCOM. \nc.  Each of the Secretaries of the Military Departments, coordinating as appropriate \nwith the other Military Department Secretaries and with the CCDRs, has the responsibility \nfor organizing, training, equipping, and providing forces to fulfill specific roles and for \nadministering and supporting these forces.  The Secretaries also perform a role as a force \nprovider of Service retained forces until they are deployed to CCMDs.  When addressing \nsimilar issues regarding National Guard forces, coordination with the National Guard \nBureau (NGB) is essential.  \nd.  Commanders of Service forces are responsible to Secretaries of the Military \nDepartments through their respective Service Chiefs for the administration, training, and \nreadiness of their unit(s).  Commanders of forces assigned to the CCMDs are under the \nauthority, direction, and control of (and are responsible to) their CCDR to carry out \nassigned operational missions, joint training and exercises, and logistics. \ne.  The USCG is a military Service and a branch of the US Armed Forces at all times.  \nHowever, it is established separately by law as a Service in DHS, except when transferred \nto the Department of the Navy (DON) during time of war or when the President so directs.  \nAuthorities vested in the USCG under Title 10, USC, as an armed Service and Title 14, \nUSC, as a federal maritime safety and law enforcement agency remain in effect at all times, \nincluding when USCG forces are operating within DOD/DON chain of command.  USCG \ncommanders and forces may be attached to JFCs in performance of any activity for which \nthey are qualified.  Coast Guard units routinely serve alongside Navy counterparts \noperating within a naval task organization in support of a maritime component	Federation of American Scientists
america_doctrine_81	America		commander. \nf.  The NGB is a joint activity of DOD.  The NGB performs certain military Service-\nspecific functions and unique functions on matters involving non-federalized National \nGuard forces.  The NGB is responsible for ensuring that units and members of the Army \nNational Guard and the Air National Guard are trained by the states to provide trained and \nequipped units to fulfill assigned missions in federal and non-federal statuses. \ng.  In addition to the Services above, a number of DOD agencies provide combat \nsupport or combat service support to joint forces and are designated as CSAs.  CSAs, \nestablished under SecDef authority under Title 10, USC, Section 193, and Department of \nDefense Directive (DODD) 3000.06, Combat Support Agencies, are the DIA, National \nGeospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA), Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), \nDLA, Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA), DTRA, and National Security \n \nDoctrine Governing Unified Direction of Armed Forces \nII-13 \nAgency (NSA).  These CSAs provide CCDRs specialized support and operate in a \nsupporting role.  The CSA directors are accountable to SecDef. \n9.  Relationship Among Combatant Commanders, Military Department Secretaries, \nService Chiefs, and Forces \na.  Continuous Coordination.  The Services and USSOCOM (in areas unique to SO) \nshare the division of responsibility for developing military capabilities for the CCMDs.  \nAll components of DOD are charged to coordinate on matters of common or overlapping \nresponsibility.  The Joint Staff, Services, and USSOCOM headquarters play a critical role \nin ensuring that CCDRs’ concerns and comments are included or advocated during the \ncoordination. \nb.  Interoperability.  Unified action demands maximum interoperability.  The forces, \nunits, and systems of all Services must operate together effectively, in part through \ninteroperability.  This includes joint force development; use of joint doctrine; the \ndevelopment and use of joint plans and	Federation of American Scientists
america_doctrine_82	America		orders; and the development and use of joint and/or \ninteroperable communications and information systems.  It also includes conducting joint \ntraining and exercises.  It concludes with a materiel development and fielding process that \nprovides materiel that is fully compatible with and complementary to systems of all \nServices.  A key to successful interoperability is to ensure that planning processes are joint \nfrom their inception.  Those responsible for systems and programs intended for joint use \nwill establish working groups that fully represent the services and functions affected. \nCCDRs will ensure maximum interoperability and identify interoperability issues to the \nCJCS, who has overall responsibility for the joint interoperability program.  Other \ngovernment departments and agencies, IGOs, and NGOs should be invited to participate \nin joint training and exercises whenever possible. \n10.  Interagency Coordination \na.  General \n(1)  Interagency coordination is the cooperation and communication that occurs \nbetween departments and agencies of the USG to accomplish an objective.  Similarly, in \nthe context of DOD involvement, coordination refers to coordination between elements of \nDOD and IGOs or NGOs to achieve objectives.   \n(2)  CCDRs and subordinate JFCs must consider the potential requirements for \ninteragency, IGO, and NGO coordination as a part of their activities within and outside of \ntheir operational areas.  Military operations must be coordinated, integrated, and \ndeconflicted with the activities of interorganizational partners, including various HN \nagencies within and en route to and from the operational area.  Sometimes the JFC draws \non the capabilities of other organizations, provides capabilities to other organizations, and \nsometimes the JFC merely deconflicts activities with those of others.  These same \norganizations may be involved during all phases of an operation including pre- and post-\noperation activities.  Roles and relationships	Federation of American Scientists
america_doctrine_83	America		among USG departments and agencies, state, \ntribal, and local governments, must be clearly understood.  Interagency coordination forges \nChapter II \nII-14 \nJP 1 \nthe vital link between the military and the diplomatic, informational, and economic \ninstruments of national power.  Successful interorganizational coordination helps enable \nthe USG to build international and domestic support, conserve resources, and conduct \ncoherent operations that efficiently achieve shared goals. \nFor more information on interagency coordination, see JP 3-08, Interorganizational \nCoordination During Joint Operations. \nb.  Interagency Unity of Effort \n(1)  Achieving Unity of Effort.  Some of the techniques, procedures, and systems \nof military C2 can facilitate unity of effort if they are adjusted to the dynamic world of \ninteragency coordination and different organizational cultures.  Unity of effort can only be \nachieved through close, continuous interagency and interdepartmental coordination and \ncooperation, which are necessary to overcome discord, inadequate structure and \nprocedures, incompatible communications, cultural differences, and bureaucratic and \npersonnel limitations.   \n(2)  Unity of Effort Guidance.  Within the USG, the NSS guides the \ndevelopment, integration, and coordination of all the instruments of national power to \naccomplish national objectives.  The NSC is the principal policymaking forum responsible \nfor the strategic-level implementation of the NSS.  The NSC system is a process to \ncoordinate executive departments and agencies in the effective development and \nimplementation of those national security policies.  This coordination sets the stage for \nstrategic guidance provided to the CCMDs, Services, and various DOD agencies and forms \nthe foundation for operational and tactical level guidance.   \n(3)  National Security Council.  The NSC is the principal forum for \nconsideration of national security policy issues requiring Presidential determination.  The	Federation of American Scientists

america_doctrine_84	America		NSC advises and assists the President in integrating all aspects of national security policy—\ndomestic, foreign, military, intelligence, and economic (in conjunction with the National \nEconomic Council).  Along with its subordinate committees, the NSC is the principal \nmeans for coordinating, developing, and implementing national security policy.  The \nstatutory members of the NSC are the President, Vice President, Secretary of State, and \nSecDef.  The CJCS is the council’s statutory military advisor and the Director of National \nIntelligence is the council’s statutory intelligence advisor.  Officials from the Office of the \nSecretary of Defense (OSD) represent SecDef in NSC interagency groups.  Similarly, the \nCJCS, assisted by the Joint Staff, represents the CCDRs for interagency matters in the NSC \nsystem.  Other senior officials are invited to attend NSC meetings, as appropriate.  \nSubcommittees of the NSC include:  \n(a)  NSC Principals Committee (PC).  NSC/PC is the senior (cabinet-level) \ninteragency forum for considering policy issues affecting national security. \n(b)  NSC Deputies Committee (DC).  NSC/DC is the senior subcabinet \ninteragency forum for considering policy issues affecting national security.  The NSC/DC \nprescribes and reviews the work of the NSC interagency groups, helps to ensure that issues \n \nDoctrine Governing Unified Direction of Armed Forces \nII-15 \nbrought before the NSC/PC or the NSC have been properly analyzed and prepared for \ndecision, and oversees day-to-day crisis management and prevention.   \n(c)  NSC Interagency Policy Committees (IPCs).  The main day-to-day \nforum for interagency coordination of national security policy, NSC/IPCs manage the \ndevelopment and implementation of national security policies by multiple departments and \nagencies of the USG.  NSC/IPCs provide policy analysis for the more senior committees \nof the NSC system to consider and ensure timely responses to Presidential decisions.  IPCs \nare grouped as either	Federation of American Scientists
america_doctrine_85	America		regional or functional. \n(d)  Regional NSC/IPCs.  Regional NSC/IPCs may be established and \nchaired by the appropriate Under or Assistant Secretary of State with responsibility for \nregional issues (e.g., Europe and Eurasia, Western Hemisphere, East Asia). \n(e)  Functional NSC/IPCs.  NSC/IPCs, each chaired at the Under or \nAssistant Secretary level within the agency indicated, have been established for 15 various \nfunctional topics.  Some of them include: democracy, human rights, and international \noperations; counterterrorism and national preparedness; defense strategy, force structure, \nand planning (DOD); arms control; proliferation, counterproliferation, and HD; \nintelligence and counterintelligence; international organized crime; contingency planning; \nspace; and international drug control.  \n(4)  While the NSC serves as the principal forum for considering national security \npolicy issues requiring Presidential determination, the HSC provides a parallel forum for \nconsidering unique HS matters, especially those concerning terrorism within the US. \nFor more information on the NSC, see CJCSI 5715.01, Joint Staff Participation in \nInteragency Affairs, and National Security Presidential Directive-1, Organization of the \nNational Security Council System. \n(5)  Homeland Security Council.  The HSC is responsible for advising and \nassisting the President with respect to all aspects of HS, and serves as the mechanism for \nensuring coordination of HS-related activities of executive departments and agencies and \neffective development and implementation of HS policies.  Other subcommittees of the \nHSC include: \n(a)  HSC Principals Committee.  The HSC/PC is the senior (cabinet-level) \ninteragency forum for HS issues. \n(b)  HSC Deputies Committee.  The HSC/DC is the senior subcabinet \ninteragency forum for consideration of policy issues affecting HS.  The HSC/DC tasks and \nreviews the work of the HSC interagency groups and helps ensure that issues brought \nbefore the HSC/PC	Federation of American Scientists
america_doctrine_86	America		or HSC have been properly analyzed and prepared for action.  \n(c)  HSC Interagency Policy Committees.  The main forum for interagency \ncoordination of HS policy, HSC-IPCs coordinate the development and implementation of \nHS policies by multiple departments and agencies throughout the USG and coordinate \nthose policies with state and local government.  HSC-IPCs provide policy analysis for \nChapter II \nII-16 \nJP 1 \nconsideration by the more senior committees of the HSC system and ensure timely \nresponses to Presidential decisions.  There are 11 HSC-IPCs established for functional \nareas such as: detection, surveillance, and intelligence (intelligence and detection); plans, \ntraining, exercises, and evaluation (policy and plans); WMD consequence management \n(response and recovery); key asset, territorial waters and airspace, and security (protection \nand prevention); and domestic threat response and incident management (response and \nrecovery). \nFor more information on the HSC, see CJCSI 5715.01, Joint Staff Participation in \nInteragency Affairs, and Homeland Security Presidential Directive-1, Organization and \nOperations of the Homeland Security Council. \nc.  Interagency Coordination and Integration \n(1)  The guidelines for interagency coordination ensure that all participating \ndepartments and agencies under appropriate authority focus their efforts on national \nobjectives.  The Armed Forces of the United States have unique capabilities to offer the \ninteragency community.  These include established military-to-military domestic and \ninternational contacts, resources (e.g., logistics) not available to nonmilitary agencies, \ntrained civil affairs (CA) personnel and their assets, and responsiveness based on military \ntraining and readiness.  Additional unique military capabilities include C2 resources \nsupported by worldwide communications and intelligence, surveillance, and \nreconnaissance (ISR) infrastructures; cyberspace capabilities; robust organizational and	Federation of American Scientists
america_doctrine_87	America		planning processes; training support for large numbers of individuals on myriad skills; and \nair, land, and maritime mobility support for intertheater or intratheater requirements.   \n(2)  Interorganizational Coordination in Foreign Areas  \n(a)  Interorganizational coordination in foreign areas may involve the \nexercise of USG policy regarding internationally recognized law; preexisting bilateral and \nmultilateral military relationships, agreements, and arrangements managed by US \nembassies; treaties involving US defense interests, implementation of CCMD theater \nsecurity cooperation activities; and initiatives concerning technology transfer or armaments \ncooperation and control, foreign humanitarian assistance, peace operations, or other \ncontingencies. \n(b)  At the national level, DOS leads the effort to support interagency \ncoordination overseas, forming task-oriented groups or employing the NSC system to \norganize the effort.  \n(c)  The formal US interagency structure in foreign countries operates under \nthe lead of the US chief of mission, normally an ambassador, and the country team and \nmay include US embassy PA and cultural affairs representation.  The chief of mission is \nordinarily the lead for interagency coordination abroad that is essentially nonmilitary in \nnature but requires military participation, with representation and control of the military \noperations provided by the JFC. \n \nDoctrine Governing Unified Direction of Armed Forces \nII-17 \n(d)  Within an AOR, the GCC is responsible for planning and implementing \nmilitary strategies and operations and interorganizational coordination.  Coordination \nrequired outside the geographic region may be supported by groups within the NSC system \nor individual USG departments and agencies, with lead for such coordination falling to the \nCCMD or the USG department or agency, depending on the circumstances.  In some \noperations, a special representative of the President or special envoy of the UN Secretary-	Federation of American Scientists
america_doctrine_88	America		General may be involved. \n(3)  Domestic Interagency Coordination  \n(a)  For HS-related interagency coordination that may require military \nparticipation in countering domestic terrorism and other support tasks, DHS has the lead.  \nFor HD interagency coordination, DOD will have the lead.  DHS is the primary forum for \ncoordinating executive branch efforts to detect, prepare for, prevent, protect against, \nrespond to, and recover from terrorist attacks within the US.   \n(b)  In domestic situations, US law and policy limit the scope and nature of \nmilitary actions.  SecDef retains the authority to approve use of DOD resources for \nassistance to civil authorities.  For DSCA operations within the US, the Joint Staff Joint \nDirector of Military Support (JDOMS) validates requests for assistance, determines what \nDOD capabilities are available to fulfill the request, and coordinates SecDef approval to \nuse DOD forces.  JDOMS will normally allocate Title 10, USC, forces to United States \nNorthern Command (USNORTHCOM) for operations approved by SecDef.  The National \nGuard has unique roles in domestic operations.  The National Guard in either state active \nduty or Title 32, USC, status (not in federal service) is likely to be the first military force \nto provide support for an incident.  \n(c)  Per the Posse Comitatus Act and DOD regulations, the US is generally \nprohibited from employing Title 10, USC, DOD forces to provide direct military \ninvolvement to enforce the law of the US unless expressly authorized by the Constitution \nor Congress.  For example, the President, as Commander in Chief under the Insurrection \nAct, may use the military in cases of civil disturbance and to protect USG functions and \nproperty.  It is important to note that use of military forces in the defense of the US is not \nsupport to civilian law enforcement and is not subject to the prohibitions of the Posse \nComitatus Act. \n(d)  In addition to coordinating with USG departments and agencies, other	Federation of American Scientists
america_doctrine_89	America		domestic participants may be involved, to include state, local, and/or tribal government \norganizations as well as the types of NGOs and IGOs that operate domestically and/or \ninternationally. \nFor more information on HS, HD, DSCA, and associated interagency coordination \nactivities in support of these missions, see the National Strategy for Homeland Security, \nNational Response Framework, DOD Strategy for Homeland Defense and Civil Support, \nJP 3-27, Homeland Defense, and JP 3-28, Civil Support. \n(4)  Command Relationships \nChapter II \nII-18 \nJP 1 \n(a)  Command relationships preserve the primacy of civil authorities in their \nspheres of responsibility while facilitating the full utilization of military forces as permitted \nby the Constitution, law, and directives of the President.  Military commands provide \nassistance in consonance with these directives for activities conducted under the control of \ncivil authorities. \n(b)  The relationship between NGOs, IGOs, and US military elements may \nbe viewed as an associate or partnership relationship.  These civilian organizations do not \noperate in military or governmental hierarchies and therefore do not have formal \nsupporting or supported relationships with US military forces.  However, an MOA or \nmemorandum of understanding can outline agreed to relationships.  \n(5)  Organizing for Interagency Coordination   \n(a)  Joint Interagency Coordination Group (JIACG).  When formed, a \nJIACG can provide the CCDR with an increased capability to collaborate with other USG \ncivilian agencies and departments (see Figure II-4 for a notional JIACG structure).  The \nJIACG, an element of a CCDR’s staff, is an interagency staff group that establishes and \nenhances regular, timely, and collaborative working relationships between other \ngovernmental agencies’ representatives (DOS, DHS, and others) and military operational \nplanners at the CCMDs.  JIACGs complement the interagency coordination that occurs at \nthe national level through	Federation of American Scientists
america_doctrine_90	America		DOD and the NSC and HSC systems.  JIACG members \nparticipate in deliberate and crisis action planning.  They provide a conduit back to their \nparent organizations to help synchronize joint operations with the efforts of USG \ndepartments and agencies. \n(b)  A contingency and planning focused subgroup of the JIACG is the \ninteragency planning cell.  The interagency planning cell can be organized or tailored to \noperate 24/7 to assist in and support interagency planning and/or coordination in crisis \nand/or contingency situations.  During such situations, an interagency planning cell will \nenable a coherent, efficient, and responsive planning and coordination effort through \nfocused or targeted participation by interagency subject matter experts and dedicated \nagency representatives.  An interagency planning cell should be activated to support a \nCCMD’s campaign planning efforts, ensuring interagency issues are fully considered in \nmission analysis and COA development. \nFor more information on the JIACG and the interagency planning cell, see JP 3-08, \nInterorganizational Coordination During Joint Operations. \n(6)  JTF Interagency Coordination \n(a)  There are specific policies and procedures that guide JTF interagency \ncoordination.  The unique aspects of the interagency process require the JTF headquarters \nto be especially flexible, responsive, and cognizant of the capabilities of not only the JTF’s \ncomponents, but other agencies as well.   \n \n \n \nDoctrine Governing Unified Direction of Armed Forces \nII-19 \n \n \nFigure II-4.

An effective CMOC contributes to meeting the objectives of \nall represented agencies in a cooperative and efficient manner.  To best coordinate and \ncollaborate military and civilian operations, the JTF should carefully consider where to \nlocate the CMOC (i.e., proximity to the JTF command center).  \nFor more information on the CMOC, see JP 3-08, Interorganizational Coordination During \nJoint Operations, and JP 3-57, Civil-Military Operations. \n \n \n \nFigure II-5.

Multinational Operations  \na.  General  \n(1)  International partnerships continue to underpin unified efforts to address 21st \ncentury challenges.  Shared principles, a common view of threats, and commitment to \ncooperation provide far greater security than the US could achieve independently.  These \npartnerships must be nurtured and developed to ensure their relevance even as new \nchallenges emerge.  The ability of the US and its allies to work together to influence the \nglobal environment is fundamental to defeating 21st century threats.  Wherever possible, \nthe US works with or through other nations, enabling allied and partner capabilities to build \ntheir capacity and develop mechanisms to share the risks and responsibility of today’s \ncomplex challenges. \n(2)  Operations conducted by forces of two or more nations are termed \n“multinational operations.”  Such operations are usually undertaken within the structure of \na coalition or alliance.  Other possible arrangements include supervision by an IGO such \nas the UN or the Organization for Security and Co-Operation in Europe.  Other commonly \nused terms for multinational operations include allied,	Federation of American Scientists
america_doctrine_93	America		bilateral, or multilateral, as \nappropriate.  \n(a)  An alliance is a relationship that results from a formal agreement (e.g., \ntreaty) between two or more nations for broad, long-term objectives that further the \ncommon interests of the members.  Operations conducted with units from two or more \nallies are referred to as combined operations.  \n(b)  A coalition is an ad hoc arrangement between two or more nations for \ncommon action.  Coalitions are formed by different nations with specific objectives, \nusually for a single occasion or for longer cooperation in a narrow sector of common \ninterest.  Operations conducted with units from two or more coalition members are referred \nto as coalition operations. \n(3)  Cultural, psychological, religious, economic, technological, informational, \nand political factors as well as transnational dangers all impact multinational operations.  \nMany contingency plans to deter or counter threats are prepared within the context of a \ntreaty or alliance framework.  Sometimes they are developed in a less structured coalition \nframework, based on temporary agreements or arrangements.  Much of the information \nand guidance provided for unified action and joint operations are applicable to \nmultinational operations.  However, differences in laws, doctrine, organization, weapons, \nequipment, terminology, culture, politics, religion, and language within alliances and \ncoalitions must be considered.  Normally, each alliance or coalition develops its own plans \nand orders to guide multinational action. \n(4)  No single command structure best fits the needs of all alliances and coalitions.  \nEach coalition or alliance will create the structure that best meets the objectives, political \nrealities, and constraints of the participating nations.  Political considerations heavily \ninfluence the ultimate shape of the command structure.  However, participating nations \nChapter II \nII-22 \nJP 1 \nshould strive to achieve unity of effort for the operation	Federation of American Scientists
america_doctrine_94	America		to the maximum extent possible, \nwith missions, tasks, responsibilities, and authorities clearly defined and understood by all \nparticipants.  While command relationships are well defined in US doctrine, they are not \nnecessarily part of the doctrinal lexicon of nations in an alliance or coalition. \nb.  Multinational Unity of Effort.  Attaining unity of effort through unity of \ncommand for a multinational operation may not be politically feasible, but it should be a \ngoal.  There must be a common understanding among all national forces of the overall aim \nof the MNF and the plan for its attainment.  A coordinated policy, particularly on such \nmatters as multinational force commanders’ (MNFCs’) authority over national logistics \n(including infrastructure), ROE, fratricide prevention, and ISR is essential for unity of \neffort.  While the tenets discussed below cannot guarantee success, ignoring them may lead \nto mission failure due to a lack of unity of effort. \n(1)  Respect.  In assigning missions, the commander must consider that national \nhonor and prestige may be as important to a contributing nation as combat capability.  All \npartners must be included in the planning process and their opinions must be sought in \nmission assignment.  Understanding, consideration, and acceptance of partner ideas are \nessential to effective communication across cultures, as are respect for each partner’s \nculture, religion, customs, history, and values.  Junior officers in command of small \nnational contingents may be the senior representatives of their government within the \nMNFs and, as such, should be treated with special consideration beyond their US \nequivalent rank.  \n (2)  Rapport.  US commanders and staffs should establish rapport with their \ncounterparts from partner countries, as well as the MNFC.  This requires personal, direct \nrelationships that only they can develop.  Good rapport between leaders will improve \nteamwork among their staffs and subordinate commanders and	Federation of American Scientists
america_doctrine_95	America		overall unity of effort.  \n(3)  Knowledge of Partners.  US commanders and their staffs should have an \nunderstanding of each member of the MNF.  Much time and effort is expended in learning \nabout the enemy; a similar effort is required to understand the doctrine, capabilities, \nstrategic goals, culture, religion, customs, history, and values of each partner.  This will \nensure the effective integration of multinational partners into the operation and enhance \nthe synergistic effectiveness of the MNF.  \n(4)  Patience.  Effective partnerships take time and attention to develop.  Diligent \npursuit of a trusting, mutually beneficial relationship with multinational partners requires \nuntiring, evenhanded patience.  This is easier to accomplish within alliances but is equally \nnecessary regarding prospective multinational partners. \n(5)  Coordination.  Coordinated policy, particularly on such matters as MNFCs’ \nauthority over national logistics (including infrastructure) and ISR, is required.  \nCoordinated planning for ROE, RUF, fratricide prevention, IO, communications, special \nweapons, source and employment of reserves, and timing of operations is essential for unity \nof effort.  Actions to improve interoperability and the ability to share information need to \nbe addressed early.  This includes an emphasis on the uses of multinational doctrine and \n \nDoctrine Governing Unified Direction of Armed Forces \nII-23 \ntactics, techniques, and procedures; development of ISR, C2 systems, and logistic \narchitectures; multinational training and exercises; and establishment of liaison structures.  \nNations should exchange qualified liaison officers at the earliest opportunity to ensure \nmutual understanding and unity of effort. \nc.  Multinational Organizational Structure \n(1)  Organizational Structure.  The basic structures for multinational operations \nfall into one of three types: integrated, lead nation, or parallel command. \n(a)  Integrated commands have representative members	Federation of American Scientists
america_doctrine_96	America		from the member \nnations in the command headquarters.  Multinational commands organized under an \nintegrated command help ensure the capabilities of member nations are represented and \nemployed properly.  A good example of this command structure is found in the North \nAmerican Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) where the commander is American, \nthe deputy commander is Canadian, and each of the regional commands has a commander \nand deputy commander from a different nation.  In addition, the NORAD staff is binational. \n(b)  Lead Nation Command Structure.  A lead nation command structure \nexists when all member nations place their forces under the control of one nation.  The lead \nnation command can be distinguished by a dominant lead nation command and staff \narrangement with subordinate elements retaining strict national integrity.   \n(c)  Parallel Command Structures.  Under a parallel command structure, no \nsingle force commander is designated.  The MNF leadership must develop a means for \ncoordination among the participants to attain unity of effort.  This can be accomplished \nthrough the use of coordination centers.  Nonetheless, because of the absence of a single \nMNFC, the use of a parallel command structure should be avoided if possible.  \n(2)  Regardless of how the MNF is organized operationally, each nation \nfurnishing forces normally establishes a national component, often called a national \ncommand element, to ensure effective administration of its forces.  The national component \nprovides a means to administer and support the national forces, coordinate communication \nto the parent nation, tender national military views and recommendations directly to the \nMNFC, facilitate the assignment and reassignment of national forces to subordinate \noperational multinational organizations, and maintain personnel accountability.  In an \nadministrative role, these national components are similar to a Service component \ncommand at the unified CCMD level in a US joint	Federation of American Scientists
america_doctrine_97	America		organization.  The logistic support \nelement of this component is referred to as the national support element. \nd.  Command and Control of US Forces in Multinational Operations.  Although \nnations will often participate in multinational operations, they rarely, if ever, relinquish \nnational command of their forces.  As such, forces participating in a multinational operation \nwill always have at least two distinct chains of command: a national chain of command \nand a multinational chain of command (see Figure II-6). \n \n \nChapter II \nII-24 \nJP 1 \n(1)  National Command.  The President retains and cannot relinquish national \ncommand authority over US forces.  National command includes the authority and \nresponsibility for organizing, directing, coordinating, controlling, planning employment, \nand protecting military forces.  The President also has the authority to terminate US \nparticipation in multinational operations at any time.  \n(2)  Multinational Command.  Command authority for an MNFC is normally \nnegotiated between the participating nations and can vary from nation to nation.  Command \nauthority will be specified in the implementing agreements and may include aspects of \nOPCON and/or TACON, as well as support relationships and coordinating authority.  A \nclear and common understanding of what authorities are specified in the implementing \nagreement is essential to operations.  This is particularly important when similar terms have \ndifferent meanings to the various participants. For example, both the US and North Atlantic \nTreaty Organization (NATO) use the term operational control and the acronym OPCON, \nbut the authorities of US OPCON are more encompassing than the authorities of NATO \nOPCON. Commanders and forces must be aware of which authorities are specified.    \n \nFigure II-6.  Notional Multinational Command Structure \nNotional Multinational Command Structure\nnational \ncommand\ncommand authority delegated \nto multinational force commander \nby participating	Federation of American Scientists

While the President cannot relinquish command \nauthority, in some multinational environments it might be prudent or advantageous to place \nappropriate US forces under the OPCON of an MNFC to achieve specified military \nobjectives.  In making this decision, the President carefully considers such factors as \nmission, size of the proposed US force, risks involved, anticipated duration, and ROE.  \nNormally, OPCON of US forces is assigned only for a specific timeframe or mission and \nincludes the authority to assign tasks to US forces already deployed by the President and \nto US units led by US officers.  US commanders will maintain the capability to report to \nhigher US military authorities in addition to MNFCs.  For matters perceived as illegal under \nUS or international law, or outside the mandate of the mission to which the President has \nagreed, US commanders will first attempt resolution with the appropriate foreign MNFC.  \nIf issues remain unresolved, the US commanders refer the matters to higher US authorities. \n1.  Within the limits of OPCON, an MNFC cannot change the mission \nor deploy US forces outside the operational area agreed to by the President.  Nor may the \nMNFC separate units, divide their supplies, administer discipline, promote anyone, or \nchange the US force’s internal organization. \n2.  Other MNF participants will normally exercise national or \nmultinational command over their own forces on behalf of their governments. \n(b)  Tactical Control.  TACON is another form of command authority \nexercised during multinational operations.  It provides	Federation of American Scientists
america_doctrine_99	America		for the detailed (and usually local) \ndirection and control of movements or maneuvers necessary to accomplish the missions or \ntasks assigned.  The commander of the parent unit continues to exercise OPCON and \nADCON over that unit unless otherwise specified in the establishing directive. \n(c)  Support.  Supporting relationships may also be established among \nparticipating forces in multinational operations.  US force commanders must be apprised \nof the opportunities, limitations, and/or conditions under which logistic support may be \nprovided to forces of other nations. \n(d)  Coordinating Authority.  In many cases, coordinating authority may be \nthe only acceptable means of accomplishing a multinational mission.  Coordinating \nauthority is a consultation relationship between commanders, not an authority by which C2 \nmay be exercised.  Normally, it is more applicable to planning than to operations.  Use of \ncoordinating authority requires agreement among participants, as the commander \nexercising coordinating authority does not have the authority to resolve disputes.  For this \nreason, its use during operations should be limited. \nFor further details concerning multinational operations, refer to JP 3-0, Joint Operations; \nJP 3-16, Multinational Operations; and the NATO series of allied joint doctrine \npublications. \n \n \nChapter II \nII-26 \nJP 1 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIntentionally Blank \nIII-1 \nCHAPTER III \nFUNCTIONS OF THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE AND  \nITS MAJOR COMPONENTS \nSECTION A.

In accordance with the National Security Act of 1947 and \nTitle 10, USC, and as described in the UCP, CCMDs are established by the President, \nthrough SecDef, with the advice and assistance of the CJCS.  Commanders of unified \nCCMDs may establish subordinate unified commands when so authorized by SecDef \nthrough the CJCS.  JTFs can be established by SecDef, a CCDR, subordinate unified \ncommander, or an existing JTF commander. \nb.  Basis for Establishing Joint Forces.  Joint forces can be established on either a \ngeographic area or functional basis. \n(1)  Geographic Area.  Establishing a joint force on a geographic area basis is the \nmost common method to assign responsibility	Federation of American Scientists
america_doctrine_114	America		for continuing operations.  The title of the \nareas and their delineation are prescribed in the establishing directive.  Note:  Only GCCs \nare assigned AORs.  GCCs normally assign subordinate commanders an operational area \nfrom within their assigned AOR. \nFor further information on operational areas, refer to JP 3-0, Joint Operations. \n(a)  The UCP contains descriptions of the geographic boundaries assigned to \nGCCs.  These geographic AORs do not restrict accomplishment of assigned missions; \nCCDRs may operate forces wherever required to accomplish their missions.  The UCP \nprovides that, unless otherwise directed by SecDef, when significant operations overlap the \nboundaries of two GCCs’ AORs, a JTF will be formed.  Command of this JTF will be \ndetermined by SecDef and forces transferred to the JTF commander through a CCDR, \nincluding delegation of appropriate command authority over those forces. \n(b)  Each GCC and subordinate JFC will be kept apprised of the presence, \nmission, movement, and duration of stay of transient forces within the operational area.  \nThe subordinate JFC also will be apprised of the command channels under which these \ntransient forces will function.  The authority directing movement or permanent location of \ntransient forces is responsible for providing this information. \n“…success rests in the vision, the leadership, the skill and the judgment of the \nprofessionals making up command and staff groups…” \nDwight D. Eisenhower \nCrusade in Europe, 1948 \nChapter IV \nIV-2 \nJP 1 \n(c)  Forces not assigned or attached to a GCC or attached to a subordinate \nJFC often are assigned missions that require them to cross boundaries.  In such cases, it is \nthe duty of the JFC to assist the operations of these transient forces to the extent of existing \ncapabilities and consistent with other assigned missions.  The JFC may be assigned specific \nresponsibilities with respect to installations or activities exempted from their control, such \nas logistic	Federation of American Scientists
america_doctrine_115	America		support or area defense, particularly if adversary forces should traverse the \noperational area to attack the exempted installation or activity.  GCC force protection \npolicies take precedence over all force protection policies or programs of any other DOD \ncomponent deployed in that GCC’s AOR and not under the security responsibility of DOS.  \nThe GCC or a designated representative (e.g., a JTF or component commander) shall \ndelineate the force protection measures for all DOD personnel not under the responsibility \nof DOS. \n(d)  Transient forces within the assigned AOR of a CCDR are subject to that \nCCDR’s orders in some instances (e.g., for coordination of emergency defense, force \nprotection, or allocation of local facilities).   \n(2)  Functional.  Sometimes a joint force based solely on military functions \nwithout respect to a specific geographic region is more suitable to fix responsibility for \ncertain types of continuing operations (e.g., the unified CCMDs for transportation, SO, and \nstrategic operations).  The commander of a joint force established on a functional basis is \nassigned a functional responsibility by the establishing authority. \n(a)  When defining functional responsibilities, the focus should be on the \nmission and objective(s) or service provided.  The title of the functional responsibility and \nits delineation are prescribed in the establishing directive. \n(b)  The missions or tasks assigned to the commander of a functional \ncommand may require that certain installations and activities of that commander be \nexempt, partially or wholly, from the command authority of a GCC in whose area they are \nlocated or within which they operate.  Such exemptions must be specified by the authority \nthat establishes the functional command.  Such exemptions do not relieve the commanders \nof functional commands of the responsibility to coordinate with the affected GCC. \nc.  Organizing Joint Forces.  A JFC has the authority to organize assigned or attached	Federation of American Scientists
america_doctrine_116	America		forces with specification of OPCON to best accomplish the assigned mission based on his \nintent, the CONOPS, and consideration of Service organizations (see Figure IV-1).  The \norganization should be sufficiently flexible to meet the planned phases of the contemplated \noperations and any development that may necessitate a change in plan.  The JFC will \nestablish subordinate commands, assign responsibilities, establish or delegate appropriate \ncommand relationships, and establish coordinating instructions for the component \ncommanders.  Sound organization should provide for unity of command, centralized \nplanning and direction, and decentralized execution.  Unity of effort is necessary for \neffectiveness and efficiency.  Centralized planning and direction is essential for controlling \nand coordinating the efforts of the forces.  Decentralized execution is essential because no \none commander can control the detailed actions of a large number of units or individuals.  \nWhen organizing joint forces with MNFs, simplicity and clarity are critical.  Complex or \n \nJoint Command Organizations \nIV-3 \nunclear command relationships or organization are counterproductive to developing \nsynergy among MNFs. \n(1)  The composition of the JFC’s staff will reflect the composition of the joint \nforce to ensure that those responsible for employing joint forces have a thorough \nknowledge of the capabilities and limitations of assigned or attached forces. \n(2)  All joint forces include Service components, because administrative and \nlogistic support for joint forces are provided through Service components.  Service forces \nmay be assigned or attached to subordinate joint forces without the formal creation of a \nrespective Service component command of that joint force.  In the absence of a formally \ndesignated Service component commander, the senior Service commander assigned or \n \nFigure IV-1.

This relationship is \nappropriate when stability, continuity, economy, ease of long-range planning, and the \nscope of operations dictate organizational integrity of Service forces for conducting \noperations. \nSee Paragraph 8, “Service Component Commands,” for more information on Service \ncomponent commands. \n(3)  The JFC can establish functional component commands to conduct \noperations.  Functional component commands are appropriate when forces from two or \nmore Military Departments must operate within the same mission area or physical domain \nor there is a need to accomplish a distinct aspect of the assigned mission.  Joint force land, \nair, maritime, and SO component commanders are examples of functional components.  \n(Note:  Functional component commanders are component commanders of a joint force \nand do not constitute a “joint force command” with the authorities and responsibilities	Federation of American Scientists
america_doctrine_118	America		of \na JFC, even when employing forces from two or more Military Departments.)  When a \nfunctional component command employs forces from more than one Service, the \nfunctional component commander’s staff should include Service representatives from each \nof the employed Service forces to aid in understanding those Service capabilities and \nmaximizing the effective employment of Service forces.  Joint staff billets for needed \nexpertise and individuals to fill those billets should be identified.  Those individuals should \nbe used when the functional component command is formed for exercises, contingency \nplanning, or actual operations. \nSee Paragraph 9, “Functional Component Commands,” for more information on \nfunctional component commands. \n(4)  Normally, joint forces are organized with a combination of Service and \nfunctional component commands with operational responsibilities.  Joint forces organized \nwith Army, Marine Corps, Navy, and Air Force components may have SOF (if assigned) \norganized as a functional component.  The JFC defines the authority, command \nrelationships, and responsibilities of the Service and functional component commanders; \nhowever, the Service responsibilities (i.e., administrative and logistics) of the components \nmust be given due consideration by the JFC. \n(5)  The JFC has full authority to assign missions, redirect efforts, and direct \ncoordination among subordinate commanders.  JFCs should allow Service tactical and \noperational assets and groupings to function generally as they were designed and organized \n(e.g., carrier strike group; Marine air-ground task force [MAGTF]; US Air Force air and \nspace expeditionary task forces; US Army corps, divisions, brigade combat teams; and SO \nJTF).  The intent is to meet the needs of the JFC while maintaining the tactical and \noperational integrity of the Service organizations.  The following policy for C2 of United \nStates Marine Corps tactical air (TACAIR) recognizes this and deals with MAGTF	Federation of American Scientists
america_doctrine_119	America		aviation \nduring sustained operations ashore. \n(a)  The MAGTF commander will retain OPCON of organic air assets.  The \nprimary mission of the MAGTF aviation combat element is the support of the MAGTF \n \nJoint Command Organizations \nIV-5 \nground combat element.  During joint operations, the MAGTF air assets normally will be \nin support of the MAGTF mission.  The MAGTF commander will make sorties available \nto the JFC, for tasking through the joint force air component commander (JFACC), for air \ndefense, long-range interdiction, and long-range reconnaissance.  Sorties in excess of \nMAGTF direct support requirements will be provided to the JFC for tasking through the \nJFACC for the support of other components of the joint force or the joint force as a whole.   \n(b)  Nothing herein shall infringe on the authority of the GCC or subordinate \nJFC in the exercise of OPCON to assign missions, redirect efforts (e.g., the \nreapportionment and/or reallocation of any MAGTF TACAIR sorties when it has been \ndetermined by the JFC that they are required for higher priority missions), and direct \ncoordination among the subordinate commanders to ensure unity of effort in \naccomplishment of the overall mission, or to maintain integrity of the force. \n2.  Unified Combatant Command \na.  Criteria for Establishing a Unified Combatant Command.  A unified CCMD is \na command with broad continuing missions under a single commander and composed \nof significant assigned components of two or more Military Departments that is established \nand so designated by the President through SecDef and with the advice and assistance of \nthe CJCS.  When either or both of the following criteria apply generally to a situation, a \nunified CCMD normally is required to ensure unity of effort. \n(1)  A broad continuing mission exists, requiring execution by significant forces \nof two or more Military Departments and necessitating a single strategic direction. \n(2)  Any combination of the following exists and	Federation of American Scientists
america_doctrine_120	America		significant forces of two or more \nMilitary Departments are involved: \n(a)  A large-scale operation requiring positive control of tactical execution by \na large and complex force; \n(b)  A large geographic or functional area requiring single responsibility for \neffective coordination of the operations therein; and/or \n(c)  Necessity for common use of limited logistic means. \nb.  The commander of a unified CCMD normally will adapt the command structure to \nexercise command authority through the commander of a subunified command, JTF, \nService component, or functional component.  Alternatively, the commander of a unified \nNote:  Sorties provided for air defense, long-range interdiction, and long-\nrange reconnaissance are not “excess” sorties and will be covered in the \nair tasking order.  These sorties provide a distinct contribution to the \noverall joint force effort.  The joint force commander must exercise \nintegrated control of air defense, long-range reconnaissance, and \ninterdiction aspects of the joint operation or theater campaign.  Excess \nsorties are in addition to these sorties. \nChapter IV \nIV-6 \nJP 1 \nCCMD may choose to exercise command authority directly through the commander of a \nsingle-Service force (e.g., task force, task group, MAGTF for a noncombatant evacuation \noperation) or a specific operational force (e.g., SOF for an SO core operation), who, \nbecause of the mission assigned and the urgency of the situation, must remain immediately \nresponsive to the CCDR.  The commander of a unified CCMD normally assigns missions \nrequiring a single-Service force to a Service component commander.  These six options \n(shown in Figure IV-2) do not in any way limit the commander’s authority to organize \nsubordinate commands and exercise command authority over assigned forces as they see \nfit.  \nc.  The commander of a unified CCMD should not act concurrently as the \ncommander of a subordinate command.  For example, the commander of a unified \nCCMD should not act	Federation of American Scientists
america_doctrine_121	America		as a functional component commander without prior approval of \nSecDef.   \nd.  Primary Responsibilities of the Commander of a Unified Combatant \nCommand.  CCDRs are responsible for the development and production of joint plans and \norders.  During peacetime, they act to deter war through military engagement and security \ncooperation activities and prepare to execute other missions that may be required.  During \na conflict/combat, they plan and conduct campaigns and major operations to accomplish \nassigned missions.  Unified CCMD responsibilities include the following: \n(1)  Planning and conducting military operations in response to crises, to include \nthe security of the command and protection of the US and its territories and bases against \nattack or hostile incursion.  The JSCP tasks the CCDRs to prepare joint contingency plans \nthat may be one of four increasing levels of detail: commander’s estimate, basic plan, \nconcept plan, or operation plan. \n \nFigure IV-2.

america_doctrine_122	America		assigned missions. \n(5)  Communicating directly with the following: \n(a)  The Service Chiefs on single-Service matters as appropriate. \n(b)  The CJCS on other matters, including the preparation of strategic, joint \noperation, and logistic plans; strategic and operational direction of assigned forces; conduct \nof combat operations; and any other necessary function of command required to \naccomplish the mission. \n(c)  SecDef, in accordance with applicable directives. \n(d)  Subordinate elements, including the development organizations of the \nDOD agency or the Military Department directly supporting the development and \nacquisition of the CCDR’s C2 system in coordination with the director of the DOD agency \nor Secretary of the Military Department concerned. \n(6)  Keeping the CJCS promptly advised of significant events and incidents that \noccur in the functional area or area of operations, particularly those incidents that could \ncreate national or international repercussions. \n(7)  Establish relationships with the CNGB to advise on National Guard matters \npertaining to their CCMD missions and support planning and coordination for such \nactivities as requested by the CJCS. \ne.  Authority of the Commander of a Unified Combatant Command in an \nEmergency \n(1)  In the event of a major emergency in the GCC’s AOR requiring the use of all \navailable forces, the GCC (except for CDRUSNORTHCOM) may temporarily assume \nOPCON of all forces in the assigned AOR, including those of another command, but \nexcluding those forces scheduled for or actually engaged in the execution of specific \noperational missions under joint plans approved by SecDef that would be interfered with \nby the contemplated use of such forces.  CDRUSNORTHCOM’s authority to assume \nOPCON during an emergency is limited to the portion of USNORTHCOM’s AOR outside \nthe US.  CDRUSNORTHCOM must obtain SecDef approval before assuming OPCON of \nChapter IV \nIV-8 \nJP 1 \nforces not assigned to USNORTHCOM within the US.  The	Federation of American Scientists
america_doctrine_123	America		commander determines when \nsuch an emergency exists and, on assuming OPCON over forces of another command, \nimmediately advises the following individual(s) of the nature and estimated duration of \nemployment of such forces. \n(a)  The CJCS. \n(b)  The appropriate operational commanders. \n(c)  The Service Chief of the forces concerned. \n(2)  The authority to assume OPCON of forces in the event of a major emergency \nwill not be delegated. \n(3)  Unusual circumstances in wartime, emergencies, or crises (such as a terrorist \nincident) may require a GCC to directly exercise COCOM through a shortened chain of \ncommand to forces assigned for the purpose of resolving the crisis.  Additionally, the GCC \ncan assume COCOM, in the event of war or an emergency that prevents control through \nnormal channels, of security assistance organizations within the GCC’s general geographic \nAOR, or as directed by SecDef.  All commanders bypassed in such exceptional command \narrangements will be advised of directives issued to and reports sent from elements under \nsuch arrangements.  Such arrangements will be terminated as soon as practicable, \nconsistent with mission accomplishment. \nf.  GCC Authority for Force Protection Outside the US \n(1)  GCCs shall exercise authority for force protection over all DOD personnel \n(including their dependents) assigned, attached, transiting through, or training in the GCC’s \nAOR, except for those for whom the chief of mission retains security responsibility. \n(2)  Transient forces do not come under the authority of the GCC solely by their \nmovement across operational area boundaries, except when the GCC is exercising TACON \nauthority for force protection purposes or in the event of a major emergency as stated in \nParagraph 2.e.(1). \n(3)  This force protection authority enables GCCs to change, modify, prescribe, \nand enforce force protection measures for covered forces. \nFor further detail concerning the force protection authority of the GCCs, refer to DODD	Federation of American Scientists
america_doctrine_124	America		2000.12, DOD Antiterrorism (AT) Program, and JP 3-07.2, Antiterrorism. \ng.  GCC Authority for Exercise Purposes.  Unless otherwise specified by SecDef, \nand with the exception of the USNORTHCOM AOR, a GCC has TACON for exercise \npurposes whenever forces not assigned to that CCDR undertake exercises in that GCC’s \nAOR.  TACON begins when the forces enter the AOR.  In this context, TACON provides \ndirective authority over exercising forces for purposes relating to force protection and to \nthat exercise only; it does not authorize operational employment of those forces. \n \nJoint Command Organizations \nIV-9 \nh.  Assumption of Interim Command.  In the temporary absence of a CCDR from \nthe command, interim command will pass to the deputy commander.  If a deputy \ncommander has not been designated, interim command will pass to the next senior officer \npresent for duty who is eligible to exercise command, regardless of Service affiliation. \n3.  Specified Combatant Command \nThere are currently no specified CCMDs designated.  Because the option for the \nPresident through SecDef to create a specified CCMD still exists in Title 10, USC, Section \n161, the following information is provided.  A specified CCMD is a command that has \nbroad continuing missions and is established by the President, through SecDef, with the \nadvice and assistance of the CJCS (see Figure IV-3). \na.  Composition.  Although a specified CCMD normally is composed of forces from \none Military Department, it may include units and staff representation from other Military \nDepartments. \nb.  Transfer of Forces from Other Military Departments.  When units of other \nMilitary Departments are transferred (assigned or attached) to the commander of a \nspecified CCMD, the purpose and duration of the transfer normally will be indicated.  Such \ntransfer does not constitute the specified CCMD as a unified CCMD or a JTF.  If the \ntransfer is major and of long duration, a unified CCMD normally would be established in \nlieu of	Federation of American Scientists
america_doctrine_125	America		a specified CCMD. \nc.  Authority and Responsibilities.  The commander of a specified CCMD has the \nsame authority and responsibilities as the commander of a unified CCMD, except that no \nauthority exists to establish subordinate unified commands. \n \nFigure IV-3.  Specified Combatant Command Organizational Options \nSpecified Combatant Command Organizational Options\n* Optional\nNote: Establishing authority providing other Service forces specifies administrative support for these forces.\nCommander\nSingle Service \nForce\nJoint Task Forces*\n(Area or Functional)\nCombatant Command   (Command Authority)\nChapter IV \nIV-10 \nJP 1 \n4.  Subordinate Unified Command \nWhen authorized by SecDef through the CJCS, commanders of unified CCMDs may \nestablish subordinate unified commands (also called subunified commands) to conduct \noperations on a continuing basis in accordance with the criteria set forth for unified \nCCMDs (see Figure IV-4).  A subordinate unified command (e.g., United States Forces \nKorea) may be established on a geographical area or functional basis.  Commanders of \nsubordinate unified commands have functions and responsibilities similar to those of the \ncommanders of unified CCMDs and exercise OPCON of assigned commands and forces \nand normally over attached forces within the assigned joint operations area or functional \narea.  The commanders of components or Service forces of subordinate unified commands \nhave responsibilities and missions similar to those for component commanders within a \nunified CCMD.  The Service component or Service force commanders of a subordinate \nunified command normally will communicate directly with the commanders of the Service \ncomponent command of the unified CCMD on Service-specific matters and inform the \ncommander of the subordinate unified command as that commander directs. \n5.  Joint Task Force \nAs shown in Figure IV-5, a JTF is a joint force that is constituted and so designated \nby SecDef, a CCDR, a subordinate unified commander,	Federation of American Scientists
america_doctrine_126	America		or an existing JTF commander.   \na.  A JTF may be established on a geographical area or functional basis when the \nmission has a specific limited objective and does not require overall centralized control of \nlogistics.  The mission assigned to a JTF requires execution of responsibilities involving a \njoint force on a significant scale and close integration of effort, or requires coordination \nwithin a subordinate area or local defense of a subordinate area.  The establishing authority \n \nFigure IV-4.  Subordinate Unified Command Organizational Options \nSubordinate Unified Command Organizational Options\n* Optional\nService\nComponents\nFunctional \nComponents*\nJoint Task Forces*\n(Area or Functional)\nAttachments*\nSubordinate \nUnified \nCommander\nOperational   Control\n \nJoint Command Organizations \nIV-11 \ndissolves a JTF when the purpose for which it was created has been achieved or when it is \nno longer required. \nb.  The authority establishing a JTF designates the commander, assigns the mission, \ndesignates forces, and delegates command authorities. \nc.  Based on the decision of the establishing JFC, the commander of a JTF exercises \nOPCON over assigned (and normally over attached) forces, or may exercise TACON over \nattached forces.  The JTF commander establishes command relationships between \nsubordinate commanders and is responsible to the establishing commander for the proper \nemployment of assigned and attached forces and for accomplishing such operational \nmissions as may be assigned.  JTF commanders also are responsible to the establishing \ncommander for the conduct of joint training of assigned forces. \nd.  Although not recommended, due to the need to concentrate on JTF-level \nconsiderations, the JTF commander also may act as the commander of a subordinate \ncommand, when authorized by the establishing authority.  When this is the case, the \ncommander also has the responsibilities associated with the subordinate command for the \nforces belonging to the parent	Federation of American Scientists
america_doctrine_127	America		Service.  The JTF establishing authority should consider that \ndual-hatting a commander also means dual-hatting the commander’s staff, which can result \nin forcing the staff to operate at the operational and tactical levels simultaneously. \ne.  The JTF commander will have a joint staff with appropriate members in key \npositions of responsibility from each Service or functional component having significant \nforces assigned to the command.   \n \nFigure IV-5.

COMMANDER, STAFF, AND COMPONENTS OF A  \nJOINT FORCE \n6.  Commander Responsibilities \na.  Responsibilities of a JFC.  Although specific responsibilities will vary, a JFC \npossesses the following general responsibilities: \n(1)  Provide a clear commander’s intent and timely communication of specified \ntasks, together with any required coordinating and reporting requirements.  Tasks should \nbe realistic yet leave subordinate commanders flexibility in their CONOPS and the ability \nto take the initiative as opportunities arise. \n(2)  Transfer forces and other capabilities to designated subordinate commanders \nfor accomplishing assigned tasks.   \n(3)  Provide all available information to subordinate JFCs and component \ncommanders that affect their assigned missions and objectives.  \n(4)  Delegate authority to subordinate JFCs and component commanders \ncommensurate with their responsibilities. \nb.  Responsibilities of a Subordinate Commander.  In addition to other \nresponsibilities that change according to circumstances, all subordinate commanders \npossess the general responsibilities to provide for	Federation of American Scientists
america_doctrine_128	America		the following: \n(1)  The accomplishment of missions or tasks assigned by the plans and orders of \nthe superior.  Authority normally is given to the subordinate commander to select the \nmethodology for accomplishing the mission; however, this may be limited by establishing \ndirectives issued by the superior JFC to ensure effective joint operations.  Any departure \nfrom the plan by a subordinate commander should, if possible, be coordinated with other \ncommanders prior to departure from the plan.  In addition, the departure must be \ncommunicated as soon as practicable to the superior. \n(2)  Advice to the superior JFC regarding employment possibilities of and \nconsequences to achieving the subordinate commander mission objectives, cooperation \nwith appropriate government and nongovernmental agencies, and other matters of common \nconcern. \n(3)  Timely information to the superior JFC relating to the subordinate \ncommander’s situation and progress. \nc.  Responsibilities of Other Commanders.  Commanders who share a common \nhigher commander or a common boundary are responsible for the following: \n(1)  Consider the impact of one’s own actions or inactions on other friendly forces. \n \nJoint Command Organizations \nIV-13 \n(2)  Provide timely information to other JFCs regarding one’s own intentions and \nactions, as well as those of nonmilitary agencies or of the adversary, which may influence \nother activity. \n(3)  Support other JFCs as required by the common aim and the situation. \n(4)  Coordinate the support provided and received. \nd.  Responsibilities of Deputy Commanders.  Deputy JFCs in a joint force may be \ndesignated as the JFC’s principal assistant available to replace the JFC, if needed.  \nNormally, the deputy commander is not a member of the same Service as the JFC.  The \ndeputy JFC’s responsibilities may include the following: \n(1)  Performing special duties (e.g., chair the joint targeting coordination board, \ncognizance of liaison personnel reporting to the joint	Federation of American Scientists
america_doctrine_129	America		force headquarters, \ninterorganizational coordination). \n(2)  Working with the components to keep the JFC updated. \n(3)  Recommending refinements in the relationship with and between the \ncomponents to provide the most efficient and effective command relationships. \n(4)  Tracking the JFC’s critical information requirements to ensure compliance. \n7.  Staff of a Joint Force \na.  General.  A joint staff should be established for commands composed of more than \none Military Department.  The staff of the commander of a CCMD, subordinate unified \ncommand, or JTF must be composed of Service members that constitute significant \nelements of the joint force.  Positions on the staff should be divided so that Service \nrepresentation and influence generally reflect the Service composition of the force. \n(1)  A JFC is authorized to organize the staff and assign responsibilities to \nindividual Service members assigned to the staff as deemed necessary to accomplish \nassigned missions. \n(2)  A joint staff should be reasonably balanced as to numbers, experience, \ninfluence of position, and rank of the Service members concerned.  The composition of a \njoint staff should be commensurate with the composition of forces and the character of the \ncontemplated operations to ensure that the staff understands the capabilities, needs, and \nlimitations of each element of the force.  The number of personnel on a joint staff should \nbe kept to the minimum consistent with the task to be performed.   \n(3)  Each person assigned to serve on a joint staff will be responsible to the JFC \nand should have thorough knowledge of the JFC’s policies. \n(4)  Recommendations of any member of the staff receive appropriate \nconsideration. \nChapter IV \nIV-14 \nJP 1 \n(5)  The degree of authority to act in the name of and for the JFC is a matter to be \nspecifically prescribed by the JFC. \n(6)  Orders and directives from a higher to a subordinate command should be \nissued in the name of the JFC of the higher command	Federation of American Scientists
america_doctrine_130	America		to the JFC of the immediate \nsubordinate command and not directly to elements of that subordinate command.  \nExceptions may sometimes be required under certain emergency or crisis situations.  C2 of \nnuclear forces is an example of one such exception. \n(7)  To expedite the execution of orders and directives and to promote teamwork \nbetween commands, a JFC may authorize the command’s staff officers to communicate \ndirectly with appropriate staff officers of other commands concerning the details of plans \nand directives that have been received or are to be issued. \n(8)  Each staff division must coordinate its actions and planning with the other \nstaff directorates concerned and keep them informed of actions taken and the progress \nachieved.  Each general or joint staff directorate is assigned responsibility for a particular \ntype of problem and subject, and for coordinating the work of the special staff divisions \nand other staff elements that relate to that problem or subject. \n(9)  Joint staff directorates and special staff sections should be limited to those \nfunctions for which the JFC is responsible or that require the JFC’s general supervision in \nthe interest of unity of effort. \n(10)  The authority that establishes a joint force should make the provisions for \nfurnishing necessary personnel for the JFC’s staff. \nb.  Staff Organization.  The staff organization should generally conform to the \nprinciples established in this section. \n(1)  Principal Staff Officer.  The chief of staff (COS) functions as the principal \nstaff officer, assistant, and advisor to the JFC.  The COS coordinates and directs the work \nof the staff directorates.  One or more deputies to the COS and a secretary of the staff may \nbe provided to assist the COS in the performance of assigned duties.  A deputy COS \nnormally should be from a Service other than that of the COS.  The secretary of the staff is \nthe executive in the office of the COS and is responsible for routing and forwarding	Federation of American Scientists
america_doctrine_131	America		correspondence and papers and maintaining office records. \n(2)  Personal Staff Group of the Commander.  The JFC’s personal staff performs \nduties prescribed by the JFC and is responsible directly to the JFC.  This group, composed \nof aides to the JFC and staff officers handling special matters over which the JFC exercises \nclose personal control will include a staff judge advocate, political advisor, PA officer, \ninspector general, provost marshal, chaplain, surgeon, historian, and others as directed.  \nJFCs should be aware that participation in multinational operations may affect the size and \nresponsibilities of this group.  \n(3)  Special Staff Group.  The special staff group consists of representatives of \ntechnical or administrative services and can include representatives from government or \n \nJoint Command Organizations \nIV-15 \nnongovernmental agencies.  The general functions of the special staff include furnishing \ntechnical, administrative, and tactical advice and recommendations to the JFC and other \nstaff officers; preparing the parts of plans, estimates, and orders in which they have primary \ninterest; and coordinating and supervising the activities for which each staff division is \nresponsible.  Because the headquarters of a joint force is concerned primarily with broad \noperational matters rather than with technical problems associated with administration and \nsupport of assigned and/or attached forces, this group should be small to avoid unnecessary \nduplication of corresponding staff sections or divisions within the Service component \nheadquarters.  When a JFC’s headquarters is organized without a special staff group, the \nofficers who might otherwise compose the special staff group may be organized as \nbranches of the divisions of the joint staff or as additional joint staff divisions. \n(4)  Joint Force Staff Directorates.  The joint staff group typically is made up of \nstaff directorates corresponding to the major functions of command, such as	Federation of American Scientists

america_doctrine_132	America		personnel, \nintelligence, operations, logistics, plans, and communications systems.  The head of each \nstaff directorate may be designated as a director or as an assistant COS.  The directors or \nassistant COSs provide staff supervision for the JFC of all activities pertaining to their \nrespective functions. \n(5)  Liaison Officers and/or Agency Representatives.  Liaisons or \nrepresentatives from various higher, lower, and adjacent organizations, DOD agencies, and \nnon-DOD entities are normally spread throughout the joint force staff and not grouped as \na separate entity.  However, considering the increasing complexity of joint and/or \ninteragency coordination, the JFC may decide to consolidate, at least administratively, \nliaisons and representatives in a single interagency office, and then provide them to specific \ndirectorates or components where they would best be employed and of value to their parent \nagency or command.  The administration and assignment of liaison officers is normally \nunder the cognizance of the deputy JFC or the COS. \n8.  Service Component Commands \na.  A Service component command, assigned to a CCDR, consists of the Service \ncomponent commander and the Service forces (such as individuals, units, detachments, and \norganizations, including the support forces) that have been assigned to that CCDR.  Forces \nassigned to CCDRs are identified in the GFMIG signed by SecDef.  Service components \ncan only be assigned under COCOM to one CCDR.  However, Service component \ncommanders may support multiple CCDRs in a supporting relationship, while not assigned \nto any of the supported CCDRs.   \nb.  Designation of Service Component Commanders.  With the exception of the \ncommander of a CCMD and members of the command’s joint staff, the senior officer of \neach Service assigned to a CCDR and qualified for command by the regulations of the \nparent Service is designated the commander of the Service component forces, unless \nanother officer is so designated by	Federation of American Scientists
america_doctrine_133	America		competent authority.  The assignment of any specific \nindividual as a Service component commander of a CCMD is subject to the concurrence \nof the CCDR. \nChapter IV \nIV-16 \nJP 1 \nc.  Responsibilities of Service Component Commanders.  Service component \ncommanders have responsibilities that derive from their roles in fulfilling the Services’ \nsupport function.  The JFC also may conduct operations through the Service component \ncommander or, at lower echelons, other Service force commanders.  In the event that a \nService component commander exercises OPCON of forces and that OPCON over those \nforces is delegated by the JFC to another component commander or other subordinate JFC, \nthe Service component commander retains the following responsibilities for certain \nService-specific functions: \n(1)  Make recommendations to the JFC on the proper employment, task \norganization, and command relationship of the forces of the Service component. \n(2)  Accomplish such operational missions as may be assigned. \n(3)  Select and nominate specific units of the parent Service component for \nattachment to other subordinate commands.  Unless otherwise directed, these units revert \nto the Service component commander’s control when such subordinate commands are \ndissolved. \n(4)  Conduct joint training, including the training, as directed, of components of \nother Services in joint operations for which the Service component commander has or may \nbe assigned primary responsibility, or for which the Service component’s facilities and \ncapabilities are suitable. \n(5)  Inform their JFC, other component or supporting commanders, and the \nCCDR, if affected, of planning for changes in logistic support that would significantly \naffect operational capability or sustainability early in the planning process for the JFC to \nevaluate the proposals prior to final decision or implementation.  If the CCDR does not \napprove the proposal and discrepancies cannot be resolved between the JFC and the Service	Federation of American Scientists
america_doctrine_134	America		component commander, the CCDR will forward the issue through the CJCS to SecDef for \nresolution.  Under crisis action or wartime conditions, and where critical situations make \ndiversion of the normal logistic process necessary, Service component commanders will \nimplement directives issued by the CCDR. \n(6)  Develop program and budget requests that comply with CCDR guidance on \nwarfighting requirements and priorities.  The Service component commander will provide \nto the CCDR a copy of the program submission prior to forwarding it to the Service \nheadquarters.  The Service component commander will keep the CCDR informed of the \nstatus of CCDR requirements while Service programs are under development. \n(7)  Inform the CCDR of program and budget decisions that may affect joint \noperation planning.  The Service component commander will inform the CCDR of such \ndecisions and of program and budget changes in a timely manner during the process in \norder to permit the CCDR to express the command’s views before a final decision.  The \nService component commander will include in this information Service rationale for \nnonsupport of the CCDR’s requirements. \n \nJoint Command Organizations \nIV-17 \n(8)  Provide, as requested, supporting joint operation and exercise plans with \nnecessary force data to support missions that may be assigned by the CCDR. \nd.  Service component commanders or other Service force commanders assigned to a \nCCDR are responsible through the chain of command, extending to the Service Chief, for \nthe following: \n(1)  Internal administration and discipline. \n(2)  Training in joint doctrine and their own Service doctrine, tactics, techniques, \nand procedures. \n(3)  Logistic functions normal to the command, except as otherwise directed by \nhigher authority. \ne.  Communication with a Service Chief.  Unless otherwise directed by the CCDR, \nthe Service component commander will communicate through the CCMD on those matters \nover which the CCDR exercises COCOM.	Federation of American Scientists
america_doctrine_135	America		On Service-specific matters such as personnel, \nadministration, and unit training, the Service component commander will normally \ncommunicate directly with the Service Chief, informing the CCDR as the CCDR directs. \nf.  Logistic Authority.  The operating details of any Service logistic support system \nwill be retained and exercised by the Service component commanders in accordance with \ninstructions of their Military Departments, subject to the directive authority of the CCDR.  \nJoint force transportation policies will comply with the guidelines established in the \nDefense Transportation System. \n9.  Functional Component Commands \na.  JFCs have the authority to establish functional component commands to control \nmilitary operations.  JFCs may decide to establish a functional component command to \nintegrate planning; reduce their span of control; and/or significantly improve combat \nefficiency, information flow, unity of effort, weapon systems management, component \ninteraction, or control over the scheme of maneuver.  \nb.  Functional component commanders have authority over forces or military \ncapability made available to them as delegated by the establishing JFC.  Functional \ncomponent commands may be established to perform operational missions that may be of \nshort or extended duration.  JFCs may elect to centralize selected functions within the joint \nforce, but should strive to avoid reducing the versatility, responsiveness, and initiative of \nsubordinate forces.  (Note:  Functional component commanders are component \ncommanders of a joint force and do not constitute a “joint force command” with the \nauthorities and responsibilities of a JFC as described in this document, even when \ncomposed of forces from two or more Military Departments.) \nc.  The JFC establishing a functional component command has the authority to \ndesignate its commander.  Normally, the Service component commander with the \npreponderance of forces to be tasked and the ability to C2 those	Federation of American Scientists
america_doctrine_136	America		forces will be designated \nChapter IV \nIV-18 \nJP 1 \nas the functional component commander; however, the JFC will always consider the \nmission, nature, and duration of the operation, force capabilities, and the C2 capabilities in \nselecting a commander. \nd.  The responsibilities and authority of a functional component command must be \nassigned by the establishing JFC.  Establishment of a functional component command must \nnot affect the command relationships between Service component and the JFC. \ne.  The JFC must designate the forces and/or military capability that will be made \navailable for tasking by the functional component JFC and the appropriate command \nrelationship(s) the functional component commander will exercise.  Normally, the \nfunctional component commander will exercise OPCON over its own Service forces made \navailable for tasking and TACON over other forces made available for tasking.  The JFC \nmay also establish support relationships between functional component commanders and \nother subordinate commanders to facilitate operations. \nf.  The commander of a functional component command is responsible for making \nrecommendations to the establishing commander on the proper employment of the forces \nand/or military capability made available to accomplish the assigned responsibilities. \ng.  When a functional component command is composed of forces of two or more \nServices, the functional component commander must be cognizant of the constraints \nimposed by logistic factors on the capability of the forces attached or made available and \nthe responsibilities retained by the Service component commanders. \nh.  When a functional component command will employ forces from more than one \nService, the functional component JFC’s staff should reflect the composition of the \nfunctional component command to provide the JFC with the expertise needed to effectively \nemploy the forces made available.  Staff billets for the needed expertise and individuals to \nfill those	Federation of American Scientists
america_doctrine_137	America		billets should be identified and used when the functional component staffs are \nformed for exercises and actual operations.  The number of personnel on this staff should \nbe kept to the minimum and should be consistent with the task performed.  The structure \nof the staff should be flexible enough to expand or contract under changing conditions \nwithout a loss in coordination or capability. \nFor additional information on C2 by functional component commanders, see JP 3-30, \nCommand and Control for Joint Air Operations; JP 3-31, Command and Control for Joint \nLand Operations; JP 3-32, Command and Control for Joint Maritime Operations; and JP \n3-05, Special Operations. \nSECTION C.  DISCIPLINE \n10.  Responsibility \na.  Joint Force Commander.  The JFC is responsible for the discipline of military \npersonnel assigned to the joint organization.  In addition to the disciplinary authority \nexercised by subordinate JFCs, a CCDR may prescribe procedures by which the senior \nofficer of a Service assigned to the headquarters element of a joint organization may \n \nJoint Command Organizations \nIV-19 \nexercise administrative and nonjudicial punishment authority over personnel of the same \nService assigned to the same joint organization. \nb.  Service Component Commander.  Each Service component in a CCMD is \nresponsible for the discipline of that Service’s component forces, subject to Service \nregulations and directives established by the CCDR.  The JFC exercises disciplinary \nauthority vested in the JFC by law, Service regulations, and superior authority in the chain \nof command. \nc.  Method of Coordination.  The JFC normally exercises disciplinary authority \nthrough the Service component commanders to the extent practicable.  When this is \nimpracticable, the JFC may establish joint agencies responsible directly to the JFC to \nadvise or make recommendations on matters placed within their jurisdiction or, if \nnecessary, to carry out the directives of a superior authority.  A joint	Federation of American Scientists
america_doctrine_138	America		military police force \nis an example of such an agency. \n11.  Uniform Code of Military Justice \nThe Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) is federal law, as enacted by Congress; \nit provides the basic law for discipline of the Armed Forces of the United States.  The \nManual for Courts-Martial (MCM), United States (as amended), prescribes the rules and \nprocedures governing military justice.  Pursuant to the authority vested in the President \nunder article 22(a), UCMJ, and in Rules for Courts-Martial (RCM) 201(e)(2)(A) of the \nMCM (as amended), CCDRs are given courts-martial jurisdiction over members of any of \nthe Armed Forces.  Pursuant to article 23(a)(6), UCMJ, subordinate JFCs of a detached \ncommand or unit have special courts-martial convening authority.  Under RCM \n201(e)(2)(C), CCDRs may expressly authorize subordinate JFCs who are authorized to \nconvene special and summary courts-martial to convene such courts-martial for the trial of \nmembers of other armed forces. \n12.  Rules and Regulations \nRules and regulations implementing the UCMJ and MCM are, for the most part, of \nsingle-Service origin.  In a joint force, however, the JFC should publish rules and \nregulations that establish uniform policies applicable to all Services’ personnel within the \njoint organization where appropriate.  For example, joint rules and regulations should be \npublished to address hours and areas authorized for liberty, apprehension of Service \npersonnel, black market activities, prescription drug and alcohol consumption, combating \ntrafficking in persons, sexual assault prevention and response policies, currency control \nregulations, and any other matters that the JFC deems appropriate. \n13.  Jurisdiction \na.  More Than One Service Involved.  Matters that involve more than one Service \nand that are within the jurisdiction of the JFC may be handled either by the JFC or by the \nappropriate Service component commander. \nChapter IV \nIV-20 \nJP 1 \nb.  One Service Involved.  Matters	Federation of American Scientists
america_doctrine_139	America		that involve only one Service should be handled \nby the Service component commander, subject to Service regulations.  A Service member \nis vested with a hierarchy of rights.  From greatest to least, these are: the US Constitution, \nthe UCMJ, departmental regulations, Service regulations, and the common law.  JFCs must \nensure that an accused Service member’s rights are not abridged or trampled.  National \nGuard members operating under Title 32, USC, or state active duty status are subject to \ntheir respective state’s jurisdiction. \nc.  A commander’s UCMJ jurisdiction may extend over persons serving with or \naccompanying the Armed Forces of the United States during military operations in \naccordance with UCMJ Article 2 (Title 10, USC, Section 802).  Criminal matters falling \noutside UCMJ jurisdiction may be managed under Title 18, USC, Sections 3261–3267 \n(also known as the Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act).  \nFor further information on appropriate procedures for exercising criminal jurisdiction \nover civilians employed by or accompanying the force, see DODI 5525.11, Criminal \nJurisdiction Over Civilians Employed By or Accompanying the Armed Forces Outside the \nUnited States, Certain Service Members, and Former Service Members.  \n14.  Trial and Punishment \na.  Convening Courts-Martial.  General courts-martial may be convened by the \nCCDR.  An accused may be tried by any courts-martial convened by a member of a \ndifferent Service when the courts-martial is convened by a JFC who has been specifically \nempowered by statute, the President, SecDef, or a superior commander under the \nprovisions of the RCM (201[e][2] of the MCM) to refer such cases for trial by courts-\nmartial. \nb.  Post-Trial and Appellate Processing.  When a court-martial is convened by a \nJFC, the convening authority may take action on the sentence and the findings as authorized \nby the UCMJ and MCM.  If the convening authority is unable to take action, the case will \nbe forwarded to an officer	Federation of American Scientists
america_doctrine_140	America		exercising general court-martial jurisdiction.  Following \nconvening authority action, the review and appeals procedures applicable to the accused’s \nService will be followed. \nc.  Nonjudicial Punishment.  The JFC may impose nonjudicial punishment upon any \nmilitary personnel of the command, unless such authority is limited or withheld by a \nsuperior commander.  The JFC will use the regulations of the alleged offender’s Service \nwhen conducting nonjudicial punishment proceedings, including punishment, suspension, \nmitigation, and filing.  However, the JFC should normally allow nonjudicial punishment \nauthority to be exercised by the appropriate Service component commander.  Except as \nnoted below, appeals and other actions involving review of nonjudicial punishment \nimposed by a JFC will follow the appropriate regulations of the alleged offender’s Service.  \nWhen the CCDR personally imposes nonjudicial punishment, or is otherwise disqualified \nfrom being the appellate authority, appeals will be forwarded to the CJCS for appropriate \naction by SecDef or SecDef designee.  Collateral decisions and processing (e.g., personnel \n \nJoint Command Organizations \nIV-21 \nand finance actions and unfavorable notations in selection records and personnel files) will \nbe handled in Service channels. \nd.  Execution of Punishment.  Execution of any punishment adjudged or imposed \nwithin any Service may be carried out by another Service under regulations provided by \nthe Secretaries of the Military Departments. \nSECTION D.  PERSONNEL SERVICE SUPPORT AND ADMINISTRATION \n15.  Morale, Welfare, and Recreation \nIn a joint force, the morale and welfare of each Service member is the responsibility \nof the Service component commander.  The JFC coordinates morale, welfare, and \nrecreation (MWR) programs within the operational area.  MWR facilities may be operated \neither by a single Service or jointly as directed by the CCDR in whose AOR the facility is \nlocated.  Facilities operated by one	Federation of American Scientists
america_doctrine_141	America		Service should be made available to personnel of other \nServices to the extent practicable.  Facilities that are jointly operated should be available \nequitably to all Services.  \nFor further information on MWR, see JP 1-0, Joint Personnel Support. \n16.  Awards and Decorations \nRecommendations for decorations and medals will be made by the JFC in accordance \nwith Service regulations or as prescribed by DOD 1348.33, Manual of Military \nDecorations and Awards, Volumes I and II, as applicable.  Recommendations for joint \nawards will be processed through joint channels.  Concurrence of the CJCS is required \nprior to initiating a request for a joint award for a CCDR.  When a member of a joint staff \nis recommended for a Service award, the JFC will process the recommendation through \nService channels.  Forward offers of personal foreign decorations through the CCDR to the \nSecretary of the appropriate Military Department.  Forward offers of foreign unit, Service, \nor campaign medals through the CCDR to the CJCS. \n17.  Efficiency, Fitness, and Performance Reports \nThe immediate superior of an officer or enlisted Service member in a joint \norganization is responsible for preparing an efficiency, fitness, or performance report in \naccordance with the guidance (and on the prescribed form) of the rated member’s Service.  \nCompleted reports will be forwarded to the reported Service member’s Service for filing.  \nA copy of the signed report will be provided to the Service member, and a copy will be \nmaintained by the senior rater in accordance with Service guidance.  Letter reports prepared \nby CCDRs for component commanders will be forwarded through the CJCS to the reported \nofficer’s Service. \nFor further information on personnel administration, refer to JP 1-0, Joint Personnel \nSupport.  \nChapter IV \nIV-22 \nJP 1 \n18.  Total Force Fitness   \na.  The most valuable resource in our military—individual Service members—are \ncontinually confronted with considerable, sustained, and	Federation of American Scientists
america_doctrine_142	America		diverse stressors that not only \nimpact their health and well-being, but impact the health and well-being of their family and \nmay ultimately impact the ability of their unit and the US Armed Forces to accomplish \nassigned missions.  \nb.  Total force fitness (TFF) provides an integrative and holistic framework to better \nunderstand, assess, and maintain the fitness of the joint force.  It assists individuals in \nsustaining their well-being, which directly contributes to their ability to carry out assigned \ntasks.  Leaders at all levels must understand, establish, and support a TFF program within \ntheir organizations.  \nc.  The character, professionalism, and values that are the hallmark of the joint force \ndemand that leaders care for our forces and their families.  TFF offers a model for meeting \nthat demand.  \nFor additional details on TFF, see CJCSI 3405.01, Chairman’s Total Force Fitness \nFramework. \n19.  Personnel Accountability \nThe JFC will establish standardized procedures to account for all personnel composing \nthe force to include obtaining initial accountability and continuous updates throughout the \nduration of the operation.  The JFC accomplishes joint personnel strength reporting and \nmanages casualty reporting.  The JFC provides personnel reports to the CCDR and CJCS \nas directed. \n20.  Religious Affairs \nReligious affairs are the commander’s responsibility and consist of the combination of \nreligious support and religious advisement.  Religious support addresses the joint \ncommander’s responsibilities to support the free exercise of religion by members of the \njoint force to the standards set by DOD and the Services and to make a good faith effort in \nsupport of the welfare of personnel.  Religious advisement addresses the commander’s \nrequirement to receive germane subject matter advice on the impact of religion on \noperations.  All military commanders are responsible for religious affairs in their \ncommand.  While the Services set standards for	Federation of American Scientists
america_doctrine_143	America		their personnel, each commander is \nresponsible for identifying religious requirements unique to his or her echelon and \ncircumstances.  Religious support consists of the accommodation of the free exercise of \nreligious beliefs through provision and facilitation of religious worship and pastoral care; \nadvising the JFC on ethics, morals, morale, command climate, and the command religious \nprogram.  Chaplains work to fulfill religious requirements in coordination with other \nchaplains and with the aid of chaplain’s assistants and religious program specialists.  \nChaplain confidentiality ensures that all members of the joint force, regardless of religious \nidentity, have the opportunity to seek human care from professionals who cannot disclose \n \nJoint Command Organizations \nIV-23 \nthe content of communications.  Religious affairs are conducted according to Service \npolicies and standards.  \nFor further information on religious support, see JP 1-05, Religious Affairs in Joint \nOperations. \n21.  Information Management \nThe JFC should ensure that all information is treated as record material and properly \nhandled to meet statutory requirements and sound records management principles as \ndefined in DODD 5015.2, DOD Records Management Program, and supported by CJCSI \n5760.01, Records Management Policy for the Joint Staff and Combatant Commands.  \n \n \nChapter IV \nIV-24 \nJP 1 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIntentionally Blank \n \nV-1 \nCHAPTER V \nJOINT COMMAND AND CONTROL \nSECTION A.  COMMAND RELATIONSHIPS \n1.  General Principles \na.  Command.  Command is central to all military action, and unity of command is \ncentral to unity of effort.  Inherent in command is the authority that a military commander \nlawfully exercises over subordinates including authority to assign missions and \naccountability for their successful completion.  Although commanders may delegate \nauthority to accomplish missions, they may not absolve themselves of the \nresponsibility for the	Federation of American Scientists
america_doctrine_144	America		attainment of these missions.  Authority is never absolute; the \nextent of authority is specified by the establishing authority, directives, and law. \nb.  Unity of Command and Unity of Effort.  Unity of command means all forces \noperate under a single commander with the requisite authority to direct all forces employed \nin pursuit of a common purpose.  Unity of effort, however, requires coordination and \ncooperation among all forces toward a commonly recognized objective, although they are \nnot necessarily part of the same command structure.  During multinational operations and \ninteragency coordination, unity of command may not be possible, but the requirement for \nunity of effort becomes paramount.  Unity of effort—coordination through cooperation and \ncommon interests—is an essential complement to unity of command.  Unity of command \nrequires that two commanders may not exercise the same command relationship over \nthe same force at any one time. \nc.  Command and Staff.  JFCs are provided staffs to assist them in the decision-\nmaking and execution process.  The staff is an extension of the JFC; its function is \ncommand support and its authority is delegated by the JFC.  A properly trained and directed \nstaff will free the JFC to devote more attention to directing subordinate commanders and \nmaintaining a picture of the overall situation.   \n(1)  Chain of command is the succession of commanding officers from a superior \nto a subordinate through which command is exercised. \n(2)  Staffing is the term used to describe the coordination between staffs at higher, \nadjacent, and subordinate headquarters.  Higher headquarters staff officers exercise no \nindependent authority over subordinate headquarters staffs, although staff officers \nnormally respond to requests for information. \n“[My job is] to give the President and the Secretary of Defense military advice \nbefore they know they need it.” \nGeneral John W. Vessey, Jr., US Army  \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff	Federation of American Scientists
america_doctrine_145	America		(18 June 1982–30 September 1985) \nChapter V \nV-2 \nJP 1 \nd.  Levels of Authority.  The specific command relationship (COCOM, OPCON, \nTACON, and support) will define the authority a commander has over assigned or attached \nforces.  An overview of command relationships is shown in Figure V-1. \n2.  Combatant Command (Command Authority) \nCOCOM is the command authority over assigned forces vested only in the \ncommanders of CCMDs by Title 10, USC, Section 164 (or as otherwise directed by the \nPresident or SecDef) and cannot be delegated or transferred. \na.  Basic Authority.  COCOM provides full authority for a CCDR to perform those \nfunctions of command over assigned forces involving organizing and employing \ncommands and forces, assigning tasks, designating objectives, and giving authoritative \ndirection over all aspects of military operations, joint training (or in the case of \nUSSOCOM, training of assigned forces), and logistics necessary to accomplish the \nmissions assigned to the command.  COCOM should be exercised through the commanders \n \nFigure V-1.

When directed in the UCP or otherwise authorized by SecDef, the commander of \nUS elements of a multinational command may exercise COCOM of those US forces \n \nJoint Command and Control \nV-5 \nassigned to that command (e.g., United States Element, North American Aerospace \nDefense Command [USELEMNORAD]). \nd.  Directive Authority for Logistics.  CCDRs exercise directive authority for \nlogistics and may delegate directive authority for a common support capability to a \nsubordinate JFC as required to accomplish the subordinate JFC’s assigned mission.  For \nsome commodities or support services common to two or more Services, one Service may \nbe given responsibility for management based on DOD EA designations or inter-Service \nsupport agreements.  However, the CCDR must formally delineate this delegated directive \nauthority by function and scope to the subordinate JFC or Service component commander.  \nThe exercise of directive authority for logistics by a CCDR includes the authority to issue \ndirectives to subordinate commanders, including peacetime measures necessary to ensure \nthe following:  effective execution of approved plans, effectiveness and economy of \noperation, and prevention or elimination of unnecessary duplication of facilities and \noverlapping of functions among the Service component commands.  CCDRs will \ncoordinate with appropriate Services before exercising directive authority for logistics or \ndelegate authority for subordinate commanders	Federation of American Scientists
america_doctrine_149	America		to exercise common support capabilities to \none of their components. \n(1)  A CCDR’s directive authority does not: \n(a)  Discontinue Service responsibility for logistic support. \n(b)  Discourage coordination by consultation and agreement. \n(c)  Disrupt effective procedures or efficient use of facilities or organizations. \n(d)  Include the ability to provide contracting authority or make binding \ncontracts for the USG. \n(2)  Unless otherwise directed by SecDef, the Military Departments and Services \ncontinue to have responsibility for the logistic support of their forces assigned or attached \nto joint commands, subject to the following guidance: \n(a)  Under peacetime conditions, the scope of the logistic authority exercised \nby the commander of a CCMD will be consistent with the peacetime limitations imposed \nby legislation, DOD policy or regulations, budgetary considerations, local conditions, and \nother specific conditions prescribed by SecDef or the CJCS.  Where these factors preclude \nexecution of a CCDR’s directive by component commanders, the comments and \nrecommendations of the CCDR, together with the comments of the component commander \nconcerned, normally will be referred to the appropriate Military Department for \nconsideration.  If the matter is not resolved in a timely manner with the appropriate Military \nDepartment, it will be referred by the CCDR, through the CJCS, to SecDef. \n(b)  Under crisis action, wartime conditions, or where critical situations make \ndiversion of the normal logistic process necessary, the logistic authority of CCDRs enables \nthem to use all facilities and supplies of all forces assigned to their commands for the \naccomplishment of their missions.  The President or SecDef may extend this authority to \nChapter V \nV-6 \nJP 1 \nattached forces when transferring those forces for a specific mission and should specify \nthis authority in the establishing directive or order.  Joint logistic doctrine and policy \ndeveloped by the CJCS	Federation of American Scientists
america_doctrine_150	America		establishes wartime logistic support guidance to assist the CCDR \nin conducting successful joint operations. \nFor further information on logistic support, refer to JP 4-0, Joint Logistics. \n(3)  A CCDR will exercise approval authority over Service logistic programs \n(base adjustments, force basing, and other aspects, as appropriate) within the command’s \nAOR that will have a significant impact on operational capability or sustainability.   \n3.  Operational Control \nOPCON is the command authority that may be exercised by commanders at any \nechelon at or below the level of CCMD and may be delegated within the command.    \na.  Basic Authority.  OPCON is able to be delegated from a lesser authority than \nCOCOM.  It is the authority to perform those functions of command over subordinate \nforces involving organizing and employing commands and forces, assigning tasks, \ndesignating objectives, and giving authoritative direction over all aspects of military \noperations and joint training necessary to accomplish the mission.  It should be delegated \nto and exercised by the commanders of subordinate organizations; normally, this authority \nis exercised through subordinate JFCs, Service, and/or functional component commanders.  \nOPCON provides authority to organize and employ commands and forces as the \ncommander considers necessary to accomplish assigned missions.  It does not include \nauthoritative direction for logistics or matters of administration, discipline, internal \norganization, or unit training.  These elements of COCOM must be specifically delegated \nby the CCDR.  OPCON does include the authority to delineate functional responsibilities \nand operational areas of subordinate JFCs. \nb.  Commanders of subordinate commands, including JTFs, will be given OPCON of \nassigned forces and OPCON or TACON of attached forces by the superior commander.  \nc.  OPCON includes the authority for the following: \n(1)  Exercise or delegate OPCON and TACON or other specific elements of	Federation of American Scientists
america_doctrine_151	America		authority and establish support relationships among subordinates, and designate \ncoordinating authorities. \n(2)  Give direction to subordinate commands and forces necessary to carry out \nmissions assigned to the command, including authoritative direction over all aspects of \nmilitary operations and joint training. \n(3)  Prescribe the chain of command to the commands and forces within the \ncommand. \n \nJoint Command and Control \nV-7 \n(4)  With due consideration for unique Service organizational structures and their \nspecific support requirements, organize subordinate commands and forces within the \ncommand as necessary to carry out missions assigned to the command. \n(5)  Employ forces within the command, as necessary, to carry out missions \nassigned to the command. \n(6)  Assign command functions to subordinate commanders. \n(7)  Plan for, deploy, direct, control, and coordinate the actions of subordinate \nforces. \n(8)  Establish plans, policies, priorities, and overall requirements for the ISR \nactivities of the command. \n(9)  Conduct joint training exercises required to achieve effective employment of \nthe forces of the command, in accordance with joint doctrine established by the CJCS, and \nestablish training policies for joint operations required to accomplish the mission.  This \nauthority also applies to forces attached for purposes of joint exercises and training. \n(10)  Suspend from duty and recommend reassignment of any officer assigned to \nthe command. \n(11)  Assign responsibilities to subordinate commanders for certain routine \noperational matters that require coordination of effort of two or more commanders. \n(12)  Establish an adequate system of control for local defense and delineate such \noperational areas for subordinate commanders as deemed desirable. \n(13)  Delineate functional responsibilities and geographic operational areas of \nsubordinate commanders. \nd.  SecDef may specify adjustments to accommodate authorities beyond OPCON in \nan establishing	Federation of American Scientists
america_doctrine_152	America		directive when forces are transferred between CCDRs or when members \nand/or organizations are transferred from the Military Departments to a CCMD.  \nAdjustments will be coordinated with the participating Service Chiefs and CCDRs. \n4.  Tactical Control \nTACON is an authority over assigned or attached forces or commands, or military \ncapability or forces made available for tasking, that is limited to the detailed direction and \ncontrol of movements and maneuvers within the operational area necessary to accomplish \nassigned missions or tasks assigned by the commander exercising OPCON or TACON of \nthe attached force. \na.  Basic Authority.  TACON is able to be delegated from a lesser authority than \nOPCON and may be delegated to and exercised by commanders at any echelon at or below \nthe level of CCMD.   \nChapter V \nV-8 \nJP 1 \nb.  TACON provides the authority to: \n(1)  Give direction for military operations; and \n(2)  Control designated forces (e.g., ground forces, aircraft sorties, or missile \nlaunches). \nc.  TACON does not provide the authority to give or change the function of the \nsubordinate commander.  \nd.  TACON provides sufficient authority for controlling and directing the application \nof force or tactical use of combat support assets within the assigned mission or task.  \nTACON does not provide organizational authority or authoritative direction for \nadministrative and logistic support.  \ne.  Functional component commanders typically exercise TACON over military \ncapability or forces made available for tasking. \n5.  Support \nSupport is a command authority.  A support relationship is established by a common \nsuperior commander between subordinate commanders when one organization should aid, \nprotect, complement, or sustain another force.  The support command relationship is used \nby SecDef to establish and prioritize support between and among CCDRs, and it is used \nby JFCs to establish support relationships between and among subordinate commanders. \na.  Basic	Federation of American Scientists
america_doctrine_153	America		Authority.  Support may be exercised by commanders at any echelon at or \nbelow the CCMD level.  The designation of supporting relationships is important as it \nconveys priorities to commanders and staffs that are planning or executing joint operations.  \nThe support command relationship is, by design, a somewhat vague but very flexible \narrangement.  The establishing authority (the common JFC) is responsible for ensuring that \nboth the supported commander and supporting commanders understand the degree of \nauthority that the supported commander is granted. \nb.  The supported commander should ensure that the supporting commanders \nunderstand the assistance required.  The supporting commanders will then provide the \nassistance needed, subject to a supporting commander’s existing capabilities and other \nassigned tasks.  When a supporting commander cannot fulfill the needs of the supported \ncommander, the establishing authority will be notified by either the supported commander \nor a supporting commander.  The establishing authority is responsible for determining a \nsolution. \nc.  An establishing directive normally is issued to specify the purpose of the support \nrelationship, the effect desired, and the scope of the action to be taken.  It also should \ninclude: \n(1)  The forces and resources allocated to the supporting effort; \n \nJoint Command and Control \nV-9 \n(2)  The time, place, level, and duration of the supporting effort; \n(3)  The relative priority of the supporting effort; \n(4)  The authority, if any, of the supporting commander to modify the supporting \neffort in the event of exceptional opportunity or an emergency; and \n(5)  The degree of authority granted to the supported commander over the \nsupporting effort. \nd.  Unless limited by the establishing directive, the supported commander will have \nthe authority to exercise general direction of the supporting effort.  General direction \nincludes the designation and prioritization of targets or objectives, timing	Federation of American Scientists
america_doctrine_154	America		and duration of \nthe supporting action, and other instructions necessary for coordination and efficiency. \ne.  The supporting commander determines the forces, tactics, methods, procedures, \nand communications to be employed in providing this support.  The supporting commander \nwill advise and coordinate with the supported commander on matters concerning the \nemployment and limitations (e.g., sustainment) of such support, assist in planning for the \nintegration of such support into the supported commander’s effort as a whole, and ensure \nthat support requirements are appropriately communicated within the supporting \ncommander’s organization. \nf.  The supporting commander has the responsibility to ascertain the needs of the \nsupported force and take action to fulfill them within existing capabilities, consistent with \npriorities and requirements assigned tasks.   \ng.  There are four categories of support that a CCDR may exercise over assigned or \nattached forces to ensure the appropriate level of support is provided to accomplish mission \nobjectives.  They are:  general support, mutual support, direct support, and close support.  \nFor example, land forces that provide fires normally are tasked in a direct support role.  \nFigure V-2 summarizes each of the categories of support.  The establishing directive will \nspecify the type and extent of support the specified forces are to provide. \nFor further information, see Appendix A, “Establishing Directive (Support Relationship) \nConsiderations.” \n6.  Support Relationships Between Combatant Commanders \na.  SecDef establishes support relationships between the CCDRs for the planning and \nexecution of joint operations.  This ensures that the supported CCDR receives the necessary \nsupport.  A supported CCDR requests capabilities, tasks supporting DOD components, \ncoordinates with the appropriate USG departments and agencies (where agreements have \nbeen established), and develops a plan to achieve the common goal.  As part of the	Federation of American Scientists
america_doctrine_155	America		team \neffort, supporting CCDRs provide the requested capabilities, as available, to assist the \nsupported CCDR to accomplish missions requiring additional resources. \nChapter V \nV-10 \nJP 1 \nb.  The CJCS organizes the JPEC for joint operation planning to carry out support \nrelationships between the CCMDs.  The supported CCDR has primary responsibility for \nall aspects of an assigned task.  Supporting CCDRs provide forces, assistance, or other \nresources to a supported CCDR.  Supporting CCDRs prepare supporting plans as required.  \nUnder some circumstances, a CCDR may be a supporting CCDR for one operation while \nbeing a supported CCDR for another. \n7.  Support Relationships Between Component Commanders \na.  The JFC may establish support relationships between component commanders to \nfacilitate operations.  Support relationships afford an effective means to prioritize and \nensure unity of effort for various operations.  Component commanders should establish \nliaison with other component commanders to facilitate the support relationship and to \ncoordinate the planning and execution of pertinent operations.  Support relationships may \nchange across phases of an operation as directed by the establishing authority. \nb.  When the commander of a Service component is designated as a functional \ncomponent commander, the associated Service component responsibilities for assigned or \nattached forces are retained, but are not applicable to forces made available by other \nService components.  The operational requirements of the functional component \ncommander’s subordinate forces are prioritized and presented to the JFC by the functional \ncomponent commander, relieving the affected Service component commanders of this \nresponsibility, but the affected Service component commanders are not relieved of their \nadministrative and support responsibilities. \nc.  In rare situations, a supporting component commander may be supporting two or \nmore supported commanders.  In these	Federation of American Scientists
america_doctrine_156	America		situations, there must be clear understanding among \nall parties, and a specification in the establishing directive, as to who supports whom, when, \n \nFigure V-2.  Categories of Support \nCategories of Support\nThat support that is given to the supported force as a whole rather than to a particular \nsubdivision thereof.\nThat support that units render each other against an enemy because of their \nassigned tasks, their position relative to each other and to the enemy, and their \ninherent capabilities.\nMutual Support\nA mission requiring a force to support another specific force and authorizing it to \nanswer directly to the supported force’s request for assistance.\nDirect Support\nClose Support\nThat action of the supporting force against targets or objectives that are sufficiently \nnear the supported force as to require detailed integration or coordination of the \nsupporting action with the fire, movement, or other actions of the supported force.\nGeneral Support\n \nJoint Command and Control \nV-11 \nand with what prioritization.  When there is a conflict over prioritization, employment, or \ntask organization between component commanders, the CCDR having COCOM of the \ncomponent commanders will adjudicate. \n8.  Command Relationships and Assignment and Transfer of Forces \nAll forces under the jurisdiction of the Secretaries of the Military Departments (except \nthose forces necessary to carry out the functions of the Military Departments as noted in \nTitle 10, USC, Section 162) are assigned to CCMDs or Commander, USELEMNORAD, \nor designated as Service retained by SecDef in the GFMIG.  A force assigned or attached \nto a CCMD, or Service retained by a Service Secretary, may be transferred from that \ncommand to another CCDR only when directed by SecDef and under procedures \nprescribed by SecDef and approved by the President.  The command relationship the \ngaining commander will exercise (and the losing commander will relinquish) will be \nspecified by SecDef.  Establishing	Federation of American Scientists
america_doctrine_157	America		authorities for subordinate unified commands and JTFs \nmay direct the assignment or attachment of their forces to those subordinate commands \nand delegate the command relationship as appropriate (see Figure V-3). \na.  The CCDR exercises COCOM over forces assigned or reassigned by the President \nor SecDef.  Forces are assigned or reassigned when the transfer of forces will be permanent \nor for an unknown period of time, or when the broadest command authority is required or \ndesired.  OPCON of assigned forces is inherent in COCOM and may be delegated within \nthe CCMD by the CCDR.     \nb.  The CCDR normally exercises OPCON over forces attached by SecDef.  Forces \nare attached when the transfer of forces will be temporary.  Establishing authorities for \nsubordinate unified commands and JTFs normally will direct the delegation of OPCON \nover forces attached to those subordinate commands. \n \nFigure V-3.  Transfer of Forces and Command Relationships Overview \nTransfer of Forces and Command Relationships Overview\n\n\n\n\nForces, not command relationships, are transferred between commands. When forces \nare transferred, the command relationship the gaining commander will exercise (and \nthe losing commander will relinquish) over those forces must be specified.\nWhen transfer of forces to a joint force will be permanent (or for an unknown but long \nperiod of time) the forces should be reassigned. Combatant commanders will exercise \ncombatant command (command authority), and subordinate joint force commanders \n(JFCs), \n will exercise \noperational control (OPCON) over reassigned forces.\nWhen transfer of forces to a joint force will be temporary, the forces will be attached to \nthe gaining command, and JFCs, normally through the Service component \ncommander,  will exercise OPCON over the attached forces.\nEstablishing authorities for subordinate unified commands and joint task forces direct \nthe assignment or attachment of their forces to those subordinate commands as \nappropriate.

In accordance with the GFMIG and the UCP, except as otherwise directed by the \nPresident or SecDef, all forces operating within the geographic area assigned to a specific \nGCC shall be assigned or attached to, and under the command of, that GCC.  (This does \nnot apply to USNORTHCOM.)  Transient forces do not come under the chain of command \nof the GCC solely by their movement across operational area boundaries, except when the \nGCC is exercising TACON for the purpose of force protection.  Unless otherwise specified \nby SecDef, and with the exception of the USNORTHCOM AOR, a GCC has TACON for \nexercise purposes whenever forces not assigned to that GCC undertake exercises in that \nGCC’s AOR. \n9.  Other Authorities \nOther authorities outside the command relationships delineated above are described \nbelow. \na.  Administrative Control.  ADCON is the direction or exercise of authority over \nsubordinate or other organizations with respect to administration and support, including \norganization of Service forces, control of resources and equipment, personnel \nmanagement, \nlogistics, \nindividual \nand \nunit \ntraining, \nreadiness, \nmobilization, \ndemobilization, discipline, and other matters not included in the operational missions of \nthe subordinate or other organizations.  ADCON is synonymous with administration and \nsupport responsibilities identified in Title 10, USC.  This is the authority necessary to fulfill \nMilitary Department statutory responsibilities for administration and support.  ADCON \nmay be delegated to and exercised by commanders of Service forces assigned to a CCDR \nat any echelon at or below the level of Service component command.  ADCON is subject \nto the command authority of CCDRs.  ADCON may be delegated to and exercised by \ncommanders of Service commands assigned within Service authorities.  Service \ncommanders exercising ADCON will not usurp the authorities assigned by a CCDR	Federation of American Scientists
america_doctrine_159	America		having \nCOCOM over commanders of assigned Service forces. \nb.  Coordinating Authority.  Commanders or individuals may exercise coordinating \nauthority at any echelon at or below the level of CCMD.  Coordinating authority is the \nauthority delegated to a commander or individual for coordinating specific functions and \nactivities involving forces of two or more Military Departments, two or more joint force \ncomponents, or two or more forces of the same Service (e.g., joint security coordinator \nexercises coordinating authority for joint security area operations among the component \ncommanders).  Coordinating authority may be granted and modified through an MOA to \nprovide unity of effort for operations involving RC and AC forces engaged in interagency \nactivities.  The commander or individual has the authority to require consultation between \nthe agencies involved but does not have the authority to compel agreement.  The common \ntask to be coordinated will be specified in the establishing directive without disturbing the \nnormal organizational relationships in other matters.  Coordinating authority is a \nconsultation relationship between commanders, not an authority by which command may \nbe exercised.  It is more applicable to planning and similar activities than to operations.  \nCoordinating authority is not in any way tied to force assignment.  Assignment of \ncoordinating authority is based on the missions and capabilities of the commands or \norganizations involved. \n \nJoint Command and Control \nV-13 \nc.  Direct Liaison Authorized (DIRLAUTH).  DIRLAUTH is that authority granted \nby a commander (any level) to a subordinate to directly consult or coordinate an action \nwith a command or agency within or outside of the granting command.  DIRLAUTH is \nmore applicable to planning than operations and always carries with it the requirement of \nkeeping the commander granting DIRLAUTH informed.  DIRLAUTH is a coordination \nrelationship, not an authority through which command	Federation of American Scientists

CCDRs will communicate with assigned RC forces through the Military \nDepartments when the RC forces are not on active duty or when on active duty for training. \ne.  CCDRs may inspect assigned RC forces in accordance with DODD 5106.04, \nCombatant Command Inspectors General, when such forces are mobilized or ordered to \nactive duty (other than for training). \nf.  CDRUSSOCOM will exercise additional authority for certain functions for \nassigned RC forces and for all SOF assigned to other CCMDs in accordance with the \ncurrent MOAs between CDRUSSOCOM and the Secretaries of the Military Departments.  \nSee DODI 1215.06, Uniform Reserve, Training, and Retirement Categories.  \nSECTION B.  COMMAND AND CONTROL OF JOINT FORCES \n11.  Background \nCommand is the most important role undertaken by a JFC.  It is the exercise of \nauthority and direction by a properly designated commander over assigned and attached \nforces.  C2 is the means by which a JFC synchronizes and/or integrates joint force \nactivities.  C2 ties together all the operational functions and tasks and applies to all levels \nof war and echelons of command.  C2 functions are performed through an arrangement of \npersonnel, equipment, communications, facilities, and procedures employed by a \ncommander in planning, directing, coordinating, and controlling forces and operations in \nthe accomplishment of the mission.  \n12.  Command and Control Fundamentals \nC2 enhances the commander’s ability to make sound and timely decisions and \nsuccessfully execute them.  Unity of effort over complex operations is made possible \nthrough decentralized execution of centralized, overarching plans or via mission command.  \nAdvances in information systems and communications may enhance the situational \nawareness (SA)	Federation of American Scientists
america_doctrine_162	America		and understanding of tactical commanders, subordinate JFCs, CCDRs, and \neven the national leadership.    The level of control used will depend on the nature of the \noperation or task, the risk or priority of its success, and the associated comfort level of the \ncommander. \na.  Tenets.  Unity of command is strengthened through adherence to the following C2 \ntenets: \n(1)  Clearly Defined Authorities, Roles, and Relationships.  Effective C2 of joint \noperations begins by establishing unity of command through the designation of a JFC with \nthe requisite authority to accomplish assigned tasks using an uncomplicated chain of \ncommand.  It is essential for the JFC to ensure that subordinate commanders, staff \nprincipals, and leaders of C2 nodes (e.g., IO cell, joint movement center) understand their \n \nJoint Command and Control \nV-15 \nauthorities, role in decision making and controlling, and relationships with others.  The \nassignment of responsibilities and the delegation of authorities foster initiative and speed \nthe C2 process.  Joint force staff principals must understand that their primary role is to \nprovide sufficient, relevant information to enhance SA and understanding for the JFC and \nfor subordinate commanders.  Once a decision is made, commanders depend on their staffs \nto communicate the decision to subordinates in a manner that quickly focuses the necessary \ncapabilities within the command to achieve the commander’s intent.  The commander \nshould give the staff the authority to make routine decisions within the constraints of the \ncommander’s intent while conducting operations.  Appropriate application of the command \nrelationships discussed previously in Section A will help ensure that the requisite amount \nof control is applied while enabling sufficient latitude for decentralized execution.  \nAdditionally, commander to staff and staff to staff relationships must be developed through \ntraining to promote the understanding of all regarding the direction	Federation of American Scientists
america_doctrine_163	America		and/or support required. \n(2)  Mission command is the conduct of military operations through \ndecentralized execution based upon mission-type orders.  It empowers individuals to \nexercise judgment in how they carry out their assigned tasks and it exploits the human \nelement in joint operations, emphasizing trust, force of will, initiative, judgment, and \ncreativity.  Successful mission command demands that subordinate leaders at all echelons \nexercise disciplined initiative and act aggressively and independently to accomplish the \nmission.  They focus their orders on the purpose of the operation rather than on the details \nof how to perform assigned tasks.  They delegate decisions to subordinates wherever \npossible, which minimizes detailed control and empowers subordinates’ initiative to make \ndecisions based on understanding what the commander wants rather than on constant \ncommunications.  Essential to mission command is the thorough understanding of the \ncommander’s intent at every level of command and a command climate of mutual trust and \nunderstanding. \n(3) Information Management and Knowledge Sharing.  Control and appropriate \nsharing of information is a prerequisite to maintaining effective C2.  For a discussion of \ninformation management and knowledge sharing, see JP 3-0, Joint Operations, and JP 3-\n33, Joint Task Force Headquarters. \n(4)  Communication.  Because JFCs seek to minimize restrictive control measures \nand detailed instructions, they must find effective and efficient ways to create cooperation \nand compliance.  Commander’s intent fosters communication and understanding with all \nsubordinates.  This common understanding builds teamwork and mutual trust.  Two joint \nC2 constructs that ensure implicit communication are the commander’s intent and mission \nstatement. \n(a)  Commander’s intent represents a unifying idea that allows decentralized \nexecution within centralized, overarching guidance.  It is a clear and concise expression of \nthe purpose	Federation of American Scientists
america_doctrine_164	America		of the operation and the military end state.  It provides focus to the staff and \nhelps subordinate and supporting commanders take actions to achieve the military end state \nwithout further orders, even when operations do not unfold as planned.   \nChapter V \nV-16 \nJP 1 \n(b)  JFCs use mission-type orders to decentralize execution.  Mission-type \norders direct a subordinate to perform a certain task without specifying how to accomplish \nit.  Within these orders, the actual mission statement should be a short sentence or \nparagraph that describes the organization’s essential task (or tasks) and purpose—a clear \nstatement of the action to be taken and the reason for doing so.  The senior leaves the details \nof execution to the subordinate, allowing the freedom and the obligation to take whatever \nsteps are necessary to deal with the changing situation while encouraging initiative at lower \nlevels. \n(5)  Timely Decision Making.  With well-defined commander’s critical \ninformation requirement, effective common operational picture and establishing clear \nobjectives, the JFC can make timely and effective decisions to get inside the adversary’s \ndecision and execution cycle.  Doing so generates confusion and disorder and slows an \nadversary’s decision making.  The commander who can gather information and make better \ndecisions faster will generate a rapid tempo of operations and gain a decided advantage.  \nConsequently, decision-making models and procedures must be flexible and allow \nabbreviation should the situation warrant it.  Adoption of a decision aid offers the \ncommander and staff a method for maintaining SA of the ongoing operation as well as \nidentifying critical decision points where the commander’s action may be required to \nmaintain momentum. \n(6)  Coordination Mechanisms.  Coordination mechanisms facilitate integration, \nsynchronization, and synergistic interaction among joint force components.  Coordinating \nmechanisms can include: agreements, memoranda of	Federation of American Scientists
america_doctrine_165	America		understanding, exchange and/or \nliaison officers, direct and integrated staffing, interoperable communications systems, \ninformation sharing, exercises, and plan development.  Integration is achieved through \njoint operation planning and the skillful assimilation of forces, capabilities, and systems to \nenable their employment in a single, cohesive operation rather than a set of separate \noperations.  A synchronization matrix may be employed to visually portray critical actions \nthat must be accomplished by multiple elements of the joint force.  Coordination is \nfacilitated through the exchange of liaisons and interoperable communications systems.  \nThese mechanisms provide the JFC with a linkage to the joint force staff and subordinate \ncommands’ activities and work to execute plans and coordinate changes required by the \nunfolding situation.  In interagency and/or multinational environments where unity of \ncommand may not be possible, unity of effort may be achieved through effective \ncoordination, exchange of liaisons, and interoperable communications and/or common \noperating systems.  Constant vertical and horizontal coordination and cooperation between \nthe CCMD and component staffs and other CCMDs are prerequisites for ensuring timely \ncommand awareness. \n(7)  Battle Rhythm Discipline.  A command headquarters battle rhythm is its daily \noperations cycle for briefings, meetings, and reporting requirements.  A battle rhythm is \nessential to support decision making, staff actions, and higher headquarters information \nrequirements and to manage the dissemination of decisions and information in a \ncoordinated manner.  A defined battle rhythm should be based on the information \nrequirements of the CCDR, subordinates, and senior commands.  It must be designed to \nminimize the time the commander and key staff members spend attending meetings and \n \nJoint Command and Control \nV-17 \nlistening to briefings; it must allow the staff and subordinate commanders time to plan,	Federation of American Scientists
america_doctrine_166	America		communicate with the commander, and direct the activities of their subordinates.  The \nbattle rhythms of the joint and component headquarters should be synchronized and take \ninto account multiple time zones and other factors.  Other planning, decision, and operating \ncycles or processes (intelligence, targeting, and air tasking order) influence the joint force \nheadquarters battle rhythm.  Further, meetings of the necessary staff organizations must be \nsynchronized.  Consequently, key members of the joint force staff, components, and \nsupporting agencies should participate in the development of the joint force headquarters \nbattle rhythm.  Those participants must consider the battle rhythm needs of higher, lower, \nlateral, and adjacent commands when developing the joint force headquarters battle \nrhythm. \n(a)  Simple, focused displays of information delivered in a disciplined way \nare necessary.  Information displayed or discussed should be mission-related.  The attention \nof the JFC and joint staff is pulled both from above, by requirements from seniors, and \nfrom below, by the needs of component commanders and their staffs.  These requirements \nmust also be integrated into the activities of the JFC, but must not be allowed to dominate \nJFC actions.  Technology offers a means to reduce the time required for conducting these \nessential C2 events.  For example, video teleconferencing and other collaborative \ncommunication tools are common methods used in many headquarters to conduct \nscheduled and unscheduled meetings and conferences that include a wide range of key \nparticipants. \n(b)  The JFC and staff must be sensitive to the battle rhythm of subordinate \norganizations.  Component commanders also need information to function properly within \ntheir own decision cycles.  The JFC should establish and require adherence to norms that \nincrease the speed of the component commanders’ decision cycles. \n(8)  Responsive, Dependable, and Interoperable Support Systems.  ISR,	Federation of American Scientists
america_doctrine_167	America		space-\nbased, and communications systems must be responsive and dependable in real time to \nprovide the JFC with accurate, timely, relevant, and adequate information.  Linking support \nsystems that possess commonality, compatibility, and standardization to the greatest extent \npossible will contribute to a higher state of interoperability and thus C2 utility.  Integrating \nthe support systems of multinational and other agency partners also must be considered. \n(9)  Situational Awareness.  The primary objective that the staff seeks to attain for \nthe commander and for subordinate commanders is SA—a prerequisite for commanders \nanticipating opportunities and challenges.  True situational understanding should be the \nbasis for all decision makers.  Knowledge of friendly capabilities and adversary \ncapabilities, intentions, and likely COAs enables commanders to focus joint efforts where \nthey best and most directly contribute to achieving objectives.  Further, the JFC’s SA must \nbe broad to include the actions and intentions of multinational partners, civilian agencies, \nadjacent commands, higher headquarters, HN authorities, and NGOs. \n(10)  Mutual Trust.  Decentralized execution, operating within the JFC’s intent, \nand mission-type orders capitalize on the initiative of subordinate commanders.  For these \nmethods to work within a joint force and for the joint force to function at all, there must be \nChapter V \nV-18 \nJP 1 \na high degree of mutual trust.  Trust among the commanders and staffs in a joint force \nexpands the JFC’s options and enhances flexibility, agility, and the freedom to take the \ninitiative when conditions warrant.  The JFC trusts the chain of command, leaders, and \nstaffs to use the authority delegated to them to fulfill their responsibility for mission \naccomplishment; and the joint force trusts the JFC to use component capabilities \nappropriately.  Mutual trust results from honest efforts to learn about and understand the \ncapabilities that each	Federation of American Scientists
america_doctrine_168	America		member brings to the joint force, demonstrated competence, and \nplanning and training together. \nb.  Decision-Making Model.  Joint operation planning occurs within the APEX \nsystem, which is the DOD-level system of joint policies, processes, procedures, and \nreporting structures, supported by communications and information technology that is used \nby the JPEC to monitor, plan, and execute mobilization, deployment, employment, \nsustainment, redeployment, and demobilization activities associated with joint operations.  \nThe APEX system formally integrates the planning activities of the JPEC and facilitates \nthe JFC’s seamless transition from planning to execution during times of crises.  The APEX \nsystem activities span many organizational levels, but the focus is on the interaction \nbetween SecDef and CCDRs, which ultimately helps the President and SecDef decide \nwhen, where, and how to commit US military capabilities.  The interactive and \ncollaborative process at the national level guides the way in which planning and execution \noccur throughout the Armed Forces. \nFor further guidance on joint operation and campaign planning, refer to JP 5-0, Joint \nOperation Planning. \n13.  Organization for Joint Command and Control \nComponent and supporting commands’ organizations and capabilities must be \nintegrated into a joint organization that enables effective and efficient joint C2.  The C2 \nstructure is centered on the JFC’s mission and CONOPS; available forces and capabilities; \nand joint force staff composition, capabilities, location, and facilities.  The JFC should be \nguided in this effort by the following principles: \na.  Simplicity.  Unity of command must be maintained through an unambiguous chain \nof command, well-defined command relationships, and clear delineation of responsibilities \nand authorities.  The JFC staff does not have direct authority over any subordinate \ncommander’s staffs.  The component staffs work solely for the component commander. \nb.  Span of	Federation of American Scientists
america_doctrine_169	America		Control.  The desired reach of the JFC’s authority and direction over \nassigned or attached forces will vary depending on the mission and the JFC’s ability to C2 \nthe actions required.  Span of control is based on many factors, including the number of \nsubordinates, number of activities, range of weapon systems, force capabilities, size and \ncomplexity of the operational area, and method used to control operations (centralized or \ndecentralized). \nc.  Unit Integrity.  Component forces should remain organized as designed and in the \nmanner accustomed through training to maximize effectiveness.  However, if a JFC desires \n \nJoint Command and Control \nV-19 \nto reorganize component units, it should be done only after careful consultation and \ncoordination with the Service component commander. \nd.  Interoperability.  C2 capabilities within joint force headquarters, component \ncommands, and supporting commands must be interoperable to facilitate control of forces.  \nThe simplest and most streamlined chain of command can be thwarted by an absence of \ninteroperability among the components’ forces and systems.   \n14.  Joint Command and Staff Process \na.  General.  The nature, scope, and tempo of military operations continually changes, \nrequiring the commander to make new decisions and take new actions in response to these \nchanges.  This may be viewed as part of a cycle, which is repeated when the situation \nchanges significantly.  The cycle may be deliberate or rapid, depending on the time \navailable.  However, effective decision making and follow-through require that the basic \nprocess be understood by all commanders and staff officers and adapted to the prevailing \nsituation.  Although the scope and details will vary with the level and function of the \ncommand, the purpose is constant: analyze the situation and need for action; determine the \nCOA best suited for mission accomplishment; and carry out that COA, with adjustments \nas necessary, while continuing to assess the	Federation of American Scientists
america_doctrine_170	America		unfolding situation. \nb.  Estimates, Decisions, and Directives.  These processes are iterative, beginning \nwith the initial recognition that the situation has changed (e.g., change of mission, change \nin the friendly or adversary situation), requiring a new decision by the commander.  The \nstaff assembles available information regarding the adversary, friendly, and environmental \nsituations and assists the commander in analyzing the mission and devising COAs.  The \nstaff then analyzes these COAs and the commander makes a decision.  This decision \nidentifies what the command is to do and becomes the “mission” paragraph of a plan or \norder.  An estimate process, as described in JP 5-0, Joint Operation Planning, may be used \nby commanders and staffs during the preparation of estimates and directives.  Simulation \nand analysis capabilities can assist in correlation of friendly and adversary strengths and \nweaknesses, as well as in analysis of COAs. \nc.  Follow-Through.  Having received and analyzed the mission, the commander \ndetermines how it will be accomplished and directs subordinate commanders to accomplish \ncertain tasks that contribute to the common goal.  Then the commander is responsible for \ncarrying out the mission to successful conclusion, using supporting staff studies, \ncoordination, and analysis relating to: \n(1)  Supervision of the conduct of operations; \n(2)  Changes to orders, priorities, and apportionment of support; \n(3)  Commitment and reconstitution of the reserve; and \n(4)  After mission attainment, consolidation and refit in preparation for the next \ntask. \nChapter V \nV-20 \nJP 1 \n15.  Command and Control Support \nA command and control support (C2S) system, which includes interoperable \nsupporting communications systems, is the JFC’s principal tool used to collect, transport, \nprocess, share, and protect data and information.  Joint C2S systems must provide quality \ninformation to allow relevant and timely JFC decisions and provide feedback on the	Federation of American Scientists
america_doctrine_171	America		intended outcome.  To facilitate the execution and processes of C2, military \ncommunications systems must furnish rapid, reliable, and secure information throughout \nthe chain of command.  All joint functions—C2, intelligence, fires, movement and \nmaneuver, protection, sustainment, and information—depend on responsive and \ndependable communications systems that tie together all aspects of joint operations and \nallow the JFCs and their staffs to initiate, direct, monitor, question, and react.  Ultimately, \neffective C2 depends on the right person having the right information at the right time to \nsupport decision making. \nFor further guidance on information quality criteria, refer to JP 6-0, Joint \nCommunications System, and JP 3-13, Information Operations. \n16.  National Military Command System \nThe NMCS is the priority component of the DOD information networks designed to \nsupport the President, SecDef, and the JCS in the exercise of their responsibilities.  The \nNMCS provides the means by which the President and SecDef can receive warning and \nintelligence so that accurate and timely decisions can be made, the resources of the Military \nServices can be applied, military missions can be assigned, and direction can be \ncommunicated to CCDRs or the commanders of other commands.  Both the \ncommunication of warning and intelligence from all sources and the communication of \ndecisions and commands to military forces require that the NMCS be a responsive, reliable, \nand survivable system.  An enduring command structure with survivable systems is both \nrequired and fundamental to NMCS continuity of operations. \nFor further information, refer to JP 6-0, Joint Communications System. \n17.  Nuclear Command and Control System \nGeneral operational responsibility for the Nuclear Command and Control System \n(NCCS) lies with CJCS and is centrally directed through the Joint Staff.  The NCCS \nsupports the Presidential nuclear C2 of the CCMDs in the areas of integrated tactical	Federation of American Scientists
america_doctrine_172	America		warning and attack assessment, decision making, decision dissemination, and force \nmanagement and report back.  To accomplish this, the NCCS comprises those critical \ncommunications system components of the DOD information networks that provide \nconnectivity from the President and SecDef through the NMCS to the nuclear CCDRs and \nnuclear execution forces.  It includes the emergency action message dissemination systems \nand those systems used for tactical warning/attack assessment, conferencing, force report \nback, reconnaissance, retargeting, force management, and requests for permission to use \nnuclear weapons.  The NCCS is integral to and ensures performance of critical strategic \nfunctions of the Global Command and Control System.  The Minimum Essential \n \nJoint Command and Control \nV-21 \nEmergency Communications Network provides assured communications connectivity \nbetween the President and the strategic deterrent forces in stressed environments. \n18.  Defense Continuity Program \nThe Defense Continuity Program is an integrated program composed of DOD policies, \nplans, procedures, assets, and resources that ensures continuity of DOD component \nmission-essential functions under all circumstances, including crisis, attack, recovery, and \nreconstitution.  It encompasses the DOD components performing continuity of operations, \ncontinuity of government, and enduring constitutional government functions to enhance \nreadiness posture. \nFor further information, refer to DODD 3020.26, Department of Defense Continuity \nPrograms. \n \n \nChapter V \nV-22 \nJP 1 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIntentionally Blank \n \nVI-1 \nCHAPTER VI \nJOINT FORCE DEVELOPMENT \nSECTION A.  FUNDAMENTALS OF JOINT FORCE DEVELOPMENT \n1.  Principles \na.  Joint force development prepares individual members and units of the Armed \nForces to field a  joint force that integrates service capabilities in order to execute assigned \nmissions. It includes joint doctrine, joint education, joint training,	Federation of American Scientists
america_doctrine_173	America		joint lessons learned, and \njoint concept development and assessment.   \nb.  The why, how, and what of joint force development are: \n(1)  Why is joint force development essential?  Each of the Services organizes, \ntrains, and equips to bring unique capabilities to the fight, and the integration of these \nService capabilities is the foundation of US warfighting capability.  Joint force \ndevelopment enables the continual improvement of joint capabilities, achieving jointness \nat the right level.  However, jointness is not automatic and it is perishable. It must be \nadvanced through continual joint force development efforts. \n(2)  The overarching process for how jointness is maintained is the joint force \ndevelopment life cycle (Figure VI-1).  Our joint warfighting capability is improved through \nthe development of concepts validated by rigorous assessment and lessons learned from \ncurrent operations.  It is sustained through joint doctrine, education, training, and exercises.  \nNew ideas are discovered through active scouting: capitalizing and exploiting innovative \nopportunities and developments occurring inside and outside of the military community.  \nThe end product is joint warfighting capability. \n(3)  The what of joint force development is a trained and capable joint force.   \n2.  Authorities \na.  Joint force development involves the synchronized execution of the legislated \nauthorities of the CJCS, the Service Chiefs, and others (such as CDRUSSOCOM).  US law \n(Title 10, USC, Section 153) gives the CJCS authority regarding joint force development, \nspecifically providing authority to develop doctrine for the joint employment of the Armed \nForces, and to formulate policies for the joint training of the Armed Forces to include \npolicies for the military education and training of members of the Armed Forces.  In \n“It’s clear we have work to finish in the current conflicts and it should be just as \nclear that we have work to do in preparing for an uncertain future.	Federation of American Scientists
america_doctrine_174	America		Our work must \nresult in a joint force that is responsive, decisive, versatile, interdependent, and \naffordable.” \nGeneral Martin E. Dempsey, US Army \n18th Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, 2011 \nChapter VI \nVI-2 \nJP 1 \nexecuting these authorities, the CJCS works in collaboration with the Service Chiefs and \nothers (such as CDRUSSOCOM) to produce joint force capabilities.   \nb.  These authorities derive from the Goldwater-Nichols Department of Defense \nReorganization Act of 1986, which significantly increased the role of the CCDRs in many \naspects of joint operations.  As a result of the Goldwater-Nichols Reorganization Act, the \nCJCS and CCDRs have a much larger role in joint force development, especially during \nthe planning, programming, and budgeting processes.  All Services contribute their unique \ncapabilities to the joint operation or campaign.  Their integration is critical to overall joint \nforce capability and effectiveness.   \nSECTION B.  JOINT FORCE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS \n3.  Joint Force Development \nJoint force development is a knowledge-based and integrated enterprise.  A discussion \nof each of the force development subordinate processes follows. \n \nFigure VI-1.

Joint Doctrine \nJoint doctrine provides the fundamental principles that guide the employment of US \nmilitary forces in coordinated action toward a common objective.  It also provides \nauthoritative guidance from which joint operations are planned and executed.   \na.  Joint Doctrine Fundamentals	Federation of American Scientists
america_doctrine_175	America		(1)  Joint doctrine is based on extant capabilities (i.e., current force structures and \nmateriel).  It incorporates time-tested principles of joint operations, operational art, and \nelements of operational design.  Joint doctrine standardizes terminology, relationships, \nresponsibilities, and processes among all US forces to free JFCs and their staffs to focus \nefforts on solving the complex problems confronting them. \nFor more discussion of the principles of joint operations, see JP 3-0, Joint Operations.  For \nmore discussion of operational art and operational design, see JP 5-0, Joint Operation \nPlanning. \n(2)  Joint doctrine is authoritative guidance and will be followed except when, \nin the judgment of the commander, exceptional circumstances dictate otherwise.  \nDoctrine does not replace or alter a commander’s authority and obligation to determine the \nproper COA under the circumstances prevailing at the time of decision; such judgments \nare the responsibility of the commander.  Joint doctrine is not dogmatic—the focus is on \nhow to think about operations, not what to think about operations.  It is definitive enough \nto guide operations while versatile enough to accommodate a wide variety of situations.  \nJoint doctrine should foster initiative, creativity, and conditions that allow commanders the \nfreedom to adapt to varying circumstances.  The judgment of the commander based \nupon the situation is always paramount. \n(3)  Joint doctrine applies to the Joint Staff, CCDRs, subordinate unified \ncommanders, JTF commanders, and subordinate component commanders of these \ncommands, the Services, and CSAs.  In developing joint doctrine, existing Service, multi-\nService, and multinational doctrine is considered.  However, joint doctrine takes \nprecedence over individual Service’s doctrine, which must be consistent with joint \ndoctrine.  Joint doctrine should not include detail that is more appropriate in Service \ndoctrine, standing operating procedures, plans, and	Federation of American Scientists
america_doctrine_176	America		other publications.  If conflicts arise \nbetween the contents of joint doctrine and the contents of Service or multi-Service doctrine, \njoint doctrine takes precedence for the activities of joint forces unless CJCS has provided \nmore current and specific guidance. \n(4)  Joint doctrine is not policy.  Policy and doctrine are closely related, but they \nfundamentally fill separate requirements.  Policy can direct, assign tasks, prescribe desired \ncapabilities, and provide guidance for ensuring the Armed Forces of the United States are \nprepared to perform their assigned roles; implicitly policy can create new roles and a \nrequirement for new capabilities.  Most often, policy drives doctrine; however, on \noccasion, an extant capability will require policy to be created.  As doctrine reflects extant \nChapter VI \nVI-4 \nJP 1 \ncapabilities, policy must first be implemented and/or new capabilities fielded before they \ncan be written into doctrine. \n(5)  When the Armed Forces of the United States participate in multinational \noperations, US commanders should follow multinational doctrine and procedures that were \nratified by the US.  For multinational doctrine and procedures not ratified by the US, \ncommanders should evaluate and follow the multinational command’s doctrine and \nprocedures where applicable and consistent with US law, policy, and doctrine.  \n(6)  Joint doctrine is developed under the aegis of the CJCS in coordination and \nconsultation with the Services, CCMDs, and CSAs.  The Joint Staff leads the joint doctrine \ndevelopment community and is responsible for all aspects of the joint doctrine process, to \ninclude promulgation.  \nFor further guidance on the development of joint doctrine, refer to CJCSI 5120.02C, Joint \nDoctrine Development System. \nb.  Purpose of Joint Doctrine \nJoint doctrine is written for those who: \n(1)  Provide strategic direction to joint forces (the CJCS and CCDRs). \n(2)  Employ joint forces (CCDRs, subordinate unified commanders, or JTF	Federation of American Scientists
america_doctrine_177	America		commanders). \n(3)  Support or are supported by joint forces (CCMDs, subunified commands, \nJTFs, component commands, the Services, and CSAs). \n(4)  Prepare forces for employment by CCDRs, subordinate unified commanders, \nand JTF commanders. \n(5)  Train and educate those who will conduct joint operations. \n5.  Joint Education \na.  Education is a key aspect of the joint force development process.   \n(1)  Professional military education (PME) conveys the broad body of knowledge \nand develops the cognitive skills essential to the military professional’s expertise in the art \nand science of war.  Additionally, affective or attitudinal learning is paired with education \nto better inculcate the values of joint service as discussed in Chapter I, “Theory and \nFoundations.” \n(2)  Service delivery of PME, taught in a joint context, instills basic Service core \ncompetency within topics associated with joint matters.  Joint education is the aspect of \nPME that focuses on imparting joint knowledge and attitudes. \n \nJoint Force Development \nVI-5 \n(3)  Joint education can be broadly parsed into three categories: \n(a)  Joint Professional Military Education (JPME).  As codified in US law \n(Title 10, USC, Section 2151) JPME “consists of the rigorous and thorough instruction and \nexamination of officers of the armed forces in an environment designed to promote a \ntheoretical and practical understanding of joint matters.”  JPME fulfills the educational \nrequirements of the 1986 Goldwater-Nichols Act.  JPME is delivered in both service and \npurely joint (e.g., the National Defense University) venues.  JPME positions officers to \nrecognize and operate in tactical, operational, and strategic levels of national security.  \nJPME curricula—based upon approved joint doctrine and concepts—address what every \nofficer should know regarding joint matters at appropriate levels from pre-commissioning \nthrough general/flag officer.   \nFor further guidance on JPME, refer to CJCSI 1800.01D, Officer	Federation of American Scientists
america_doctrine_178	America		Professional Military \nEducation Policy (OPMEP). \n(b)  Enlisted Joint Professional Military Education (EJPME).  Although \nnot mandated in US law, the joint development of enlisted personnel requires some degree \nof joint education.  EJPME is largely delivered in Service PME venues along two separate \ntracks.  The first track addresses what every enlisted member of the Armed Forces should \nknow regarding joint subjects at appropriate levels of service; the second track is specific \neducational preparation for enlisted members for joint duty.  Like JPME, EJPME curricula \nare based upon approved joint doctrine and concepts. \nFor further guidance on EJPME, refer to CJCSI 1805.01A, Enlisted Professional Military \nEducation Policy. \n(c)  Other Joint Education.  JPME and EJPME provide members of the \nArmed Forces with common education on joint matters.  JPME and EJPME curricula \nprovide “some joint content for all”—what all members of the Armed Forces should know.  \nOther joint education provides specialist education in specific joint functional areas.  Other \njoint education (sometimes called “small j” joint education to distinguish it from \nJPME/EJPME) is topic-specific education of joint material for both officers and enlisted \npersonnel.  The content of “other joint education,” albeit significant to joint officer \ndevelopment, does not otherwise meet standards to be accredited as JPME.  This type of \neducation is sponsored by topic-specific relevant Services and organizations (i.e., joint \nlogistics education by the joint logistics community).  Other joint education conveys a \nspecific body of knowledge relevant to the specific field and is also based on approved \njoint doctrine and concepts.   \nb.  Influence of Joint Education \n(1)  Joint education is based on joint doctrine and should reflect the deliberate, \niterative, and continuous nature of joint force development. Joint curricula should include \napproved joint concepts and the most recent observed lessons from	Federation of American Scientists
america_doctrine_179	America		across the joint force.   \n(2)   Joint education is closely related to individual joint training.  Policy \nrecognizes that education and training are not mutually exclusive.  Virtually all military \nChapter VI \nVI-6 \nJP 1 \nschools and professional development programs include elements of both education and \ntraining in their academic curriculum.  Effective joint learning relies on close coordination \nof training and education.  As individuals mature and develop within their military \nspecialties, they acquire the knowledge, skills, and abilities required for positions of \nincreased responsibilities. \n6.  Joint Training  \nJoint training prepares individuals, joint forces, or joint staffs to respond to strategic, \noperational, or tactical requirements considered necessary by the CCDRs to execute their \nassigned or anticipated missions.  Joint training encompasses both individual and collective \ntraining of joint staffs, units, and the Service components of joint forces. \na.  Joint Training Fundamentals \n (1)  Types of Joint Training.  Joint training must be accomplished by effectively \nmatching the training requirements and training audiences with appropriate training \nmethods and modes within available resources.  These audiences include: \n(a)  Individual Joint Training.  Training that prepares individual members \nand commanders to perform duties in joint organizations (e.g., specific staff positions or \nfunctions) or to operate uniquely joint systems.  Individuals should be proficient in \nrequisite knowledge, skills, and ability to apply joint doctrine and procedures necessary to \nfunction as staff members. \n(b)  Staff Joint Training.  Training that prepares joint staffs or joint staff \nelements to respond to strategic and operational taskings deemed necessary by CCDRs and \nsubordinate JFCs to execute their assigned missions. \n(c)  Collective Joint Training.  Instruction and applied exercises that prepare \njoint organizational teams to integrate and synchronize	Federation of American Scientists
america_doctrine_180	America		owned and provided capabilities to \nexecute assigned missions.  Collective exercise programs include the President’s National \nExercise Program (NEP), the Chairman’s Exercise Program (CEP), and the Joint Exercise \nProgram (JEP). \n1.  The NEP consists of annual, operations-based exercises, either a \nfunctional command post exercise or a full-scale exercise, involving department and \nagency principals and Presidential participation.  These national-level exercises address \nUSG strategic and policy-level objectives and challenge the national response system.  \nDOD participates in the NEP through the CEP. \n2.  The CEP is the only dedicated means for the CJCS, through the Joint \nStaff, to coordinate interagency and CCMD participation in strategic national-level joint \nexercises. \n3.  The JEP is a principal means for CCDRs to maintain trained and \nready forces, exercise their contingency plans, support their TCP, and achieve joint and \nmultinational (combined) training.  CCDR-sponsored JEP events train to mission \n \nJoint Force Development \nVI-7 \ncapability requirements described in the command joint mission-essential task list \n(JMETL) as well as theater security cooperation requirements as directed in TCPs. \n(2)  Tenets of Joint Training.  JFCs must integrate and synchronize the actions \nof their forces to achieve strategic and operational objectives.  Success depends on well-\nintegrated command headquarters, supporting organizations, and forces that operate as a \nteam.  The tenets of joint training are intended to guide commanders and agency directors \nin developing their joint training plans: use joint doctrine; commanders/agency directors \nare the primary trainers; mission focus; train the way you intend to operate; centralize \nplanning, decentralize execution; and link training and readiness assessments. \n(3)  End State.  The desired end state of joint training is a training and exercise \nstrategy aligned with the NMS that results in joint force readiness.  \n(4)	Federation of American Scientists
america_doctrine_181	America		Joint Training System (JTS).  The JTS is a four-phased methodology that \naligns training strategy with assigned missions to produce trained and ready individuals, \nunits, and staffs. \n(a)  The first phase (the Requirements Phase) identifies the required \ncapabilities identified during mission analyses by commanders or agency directors and \ntheir staffs, and are based on assigned mission responsibilities, commander’s intent, and \njoint doctrine and documented in the command/agency JMETL or agency mission-\nessential task list (AMETL). \n(b)  The second phase (the Plans Phase) is an analysis of current capabilities \nagainst required capabilities (JMETL/AMETL).  Joint training requirements are derived \nby analyzing gaps between mission capability requirements and current capability \nproficiency.  Training methods, modes, and media are determined based on the desired \nlevel of performance, which determines the type of training events required. \n(c)  The third phase (the Execution Phase) refines and finalizes, executes, and \nevaluates training events scheduled during the plans phase.  Following execution, \ncommand/agency trainers collect the task performance observations for each training \nobjective, conduct analysis, and make a formal recommendation as training proficiency \nevaluations on whether the training audience achieved the training objective. \n(d)  The fourth phase (the Assessments Phase) completes the joint training \ncycle and begins the next cycle as an input to future training plans.  It focuses on the \norganization’s capability to accomplish its assigned missions.  It may also impact near-\nterm training if critical shortcomings or deficiencies in a command’s proficiency, or in \noverall joint procedures, are identified. \n(5)  Although the process is deliberate in concept, it is flexible in execution.  The \nJTS is a systematic approach to assist commanders in ensuring readiness levels required in \ntheir command are met through effective joint training.  This	Federation of American Scientists
america_doctrine_182	America		approach assists in identifying \nthe functional responsibilities of assigned individuals and organizations in the form of \ntasks, conditions, and standards; identifying events and resources to accomplish required \nChapter VI \nVI-8 \nJP 1 \ntraining; conducting and evaluating training audience performance; and assessing their \nability to perform assigned mission tasks in the training environment. \n(6)  The JTS supports DOD implementation of the joint learning continuum by \nproviding the construct to plan and implement a comprehensive organizational program \nthat may include elements of training (individual, staff, and collective), education, self-\ndevelopment, and experience to achieve mission capability.  This process establishes the \nlinkage between the NMS and CCMD missions, operational plans, and tasks inherent in \nthose plans and joint training.  The final product is a CCDR JMETL and the CSA AMETL \nthat reflects and consolidates the mission capability requirements of the CCMD into a \nsingle list of tasks, conditions, standards, responsible individuals, and organizations. \n(7)  The JTS represents a series of logical and repeatable processes that are \nintended to continuously improve joint readiness.  Used correctly, the system helps \nCCDRs, subordinate joint force, functional, or Service commanders, other senior \ncommanders, and CSA directors to train more efficiently and identify areas for \nimprovement.  Effectively using the processes within the JTS better enables commanders \nto assess the level of training readiness in their commands and then make informed \njudgments on their ability to perform assigned missions under unified CCMD. \nb.  Influence of Joint Training \n(1)  The Universal Joint Task List (UJTL) is a doctrine-based construct detailing \na universe of military tasks linked to specific conditions and standards.  The UJTL provides \na standardized tool to support the planning, execution, evaluation, and assessment of joint \ntraining.  The UJTL offers a	Federation of American Scientists
america_doctrine_183	America		library of mission tasks for the development of \nJMETLs/AMETLs and readiness reporting as well as defining capability requirements for \nreadiness reporting, systems acquisition, and contingency operations planning. \n(2)  The ultimate objective of the joint learning continuum is the provision of \nmission-ready individuals and collective entities.  Broadly, the missions to be \naccomplished are articulated in the war plans of the CCDRs. \nFor further guidance on joint training, refer to CJCSI 3500.01G, Joint Training Policy and \nGuidance for the Armed Forces of the United States. \n7.  Lessons Learned \na.  The joint lessons learned component of joint force development entails collecting \nobservations, analyzing them, and taking the necessary steps to turn them into “learned \nlessons”—changes in behavior that improve the mission ready capabilities of the joint \nforce.  The conduct of joint operations provides the truest test of joint doctrine, joint \neducation, and joint training.  Accordingly, it is crucially important to observe keenly the \nconduct of joint operations, as well as the execution of each part of the joint force \ndevelopment process, in order to continuously identify and assess the strengths and \nweaknesses of joint doctrine, joint education, and joint training as well as strategy, policy, \nmateriel, and supporting military systems.  Properly assessed, these positive and negative \nobservations help senior leaders identify and fix problems, reinforce success, and inside \n \nJoint Force Development \nVI-9 \nthe joint force development perspective, adjust the azimuth and interaction of the various \nlines of effort. \nb.  The Joint Lessons Learned Program (JLLP) is focused on improving joint \npreparedness and performance.  Its primary objective is to enhance our abilities to conduct \njoint operations by contributing to improvements in doctrine, organization, training, \nmateriel, leadership and education, personnel, facilities, and policy.  It enhances joint force	Federation of American Scientists
america_doctrine_184	America		capabilities by enabling learning and collaboration from joint activities, including \nengagement, planning, training, exercises, experiments, operations, real-world events, and \nother activities involving the Armed Forces of the United States.  The JLLP improves \nperformance through discovery, evaluation, validation, and integration with learning and \nresolution processes, to ensure lessons are learned and integrated across DOD.  Learned \nlessons are the building blocks that feed the revisions and updates to doctrine, education, \nand training.  They identify gaps and common issues, and lead to the capture and \nimplementation of best practices and experiences of DOD forces.  Ultimately, this leads to \nthe development of new capabilities and improvements in the readiness of our forces.  The \nJLLP is designed to support the USG whole-of-government effort by sharing and \ncollaborating learned lessons information with other USG organizations and multinational \npartners. \nFor further guidance on the JLLP, refer to CJCSI 3150.25E, Joint Lessons Learned \nProgram. \n8.  Joint Concepts and Assessment  \na.  Joint concepts examine military problems and propose solutions describing how \nthe joint force, using military art and science, may operate to achieve strategic goals within \nthe context of the anticipated future security environment.  Joint concepts lead to military \ncapabilities, both non-materiel and materiel, that significantly improve the ability of the \njoint force to overcome future challenges.   \nb.  Joint Concept Fundamentals \n(1)  Joint concepts provide solutions to compelling, real-world challenges both \ncurrent and envisioned for which existing doctrinal approaches and joint capabilities are \ndeemed inadequate. The absence of doctrine may indicate that the joint force has \nencountered a situation with which there has been no previous experience.  As battlefield \nconditions, technology, and opposing force capabilities evolve, concept development \nprovides a means	Federation of American Scientists
america_doctrine_185	America		to address these challenges.  Concepts proceed from an understanding of \nexisting doctrine or knowledge of existing capabilities.  They must propose a clear \nalternative to existing doctrine or augmentation of existing capabilities and demonstrate \nevidence of significant operational value relative to the challenges under consideration. \n(2)  Joint concepts are idea-focused and are not constrained by existing policies, \ntreaties, laws, or technology.  This permits the development of concepts that anticipate \nconditions as they may exist in the future.  In this way it is possible to start with an idea—\na visualization of how forces could successfully operate against specific challenges and \nChapter VI \nVI-10 \nJP 1 \nacross the joint functions—and proceed to describe new employment methodologies for \nexisting capabilities as well as new capability requirements. \n(3)  Joint concept development and assessment is focused on mitigating DOD’s \nhighest joint force development needs.  Using joint force development priorities as \ndetermined by the CJCS, CCMDs and Services identify and nominate proposals to solve \ncurrent or anticipated capability gaps annually via the Comprehensive Joint Assessment.  \nOnce nominated these proposals are consolidated, reviewed, and assigned a proposed \npriority.  A proposed list of projects and associated priority are reviewed by the Joint \nCapabilities Board and forwarded to the JROC for approval.  Upon approval by the JROC \nthis list becomes the joint concept development and experimentation annual program of \nwork. \n(4)  Joint concepts are developed collaboratively to ensure that a wide range of \nideas and perspectives are considered for developing a deep understanding of the problem \nand generating options for solving that problem.  Military leaders and other subject matter \nexperts from a variety of backgrounds collectively assess the challenge and identify \npotential solutions.  The process employs a systematic methodology for incorporating	Federation of American Scientists
america_doctrine_186	America		real-\nworld observations, concerns, or issues as well as consideration of a wide range of \ninnovative ideas for more effective future operations. \n(5)  Joint concepts are rigorously evaluated.  Joint concepts are objectively \nevaluated to ensure that proposed solutions will enable the joint force to successfully \novercome the operational challenges the concept was intended to address.  The validation \nprocess involves testing the ideas during development; first in assessments under controlled \nenvironments and then in operational environments, such as exercises. \nc.  Joint Concept Assessment.  A joint assessment is an analytical activity based on \nunbiased trials conducted under controlled conditions within a representative environment, \nto validate a concept, hypothesis, discover something new, or establish knowledge.  Results \nof an assessment are reproducible and provide defensible analytic evidence for joint force \ndevelopment decisions.  Assessments and wargames provide the means to determine the \nefficacy of proposed capability to challenges, problems, and issues facing CCMDs, \nServices, agencies, and MNFs.   \n(1)  Joint assessment uses a variety of methodologies to develop and evaluate \ncapabilities to mitigate the joint force’s most pressing challenges.  These various \napproaches enable joint force development by increasing understanding, developing \nknowledge, or improving capabilities.  These approaches range from discovery events, \nworkshops, and seminars to hypothesis testing and demonstrations.  Regardless of the \napproach the goal is to produce operationally relevant, credible, defensible, and sustainable \njoint capabilities.   \n(2)  Joint assessment is planned and executed in a collaborative five phase cycle.  \nThis cycle uses a find, plan, experiment, finish, and exploit process model, incorporating \ncontinuous project and program assessment. \n \nJoint Force Development \nVI-11 \nd.  Influence of Joint Concepts and Assessment \n(1)  Joint concepts and	Federation of American Scientists
america_doctrine_187	America		validated results from joint assessments are deliberately \ntransitioned to non-materiel capability development systems to become sustainable joint \ncapabilities.  Once validated and approved, concepts and solutions are actively transitioned \nvia the force development process in order to institutionalize the solutions.  Succeeding in \nthis requires the establishment of three types of organizational sponsorship to deliver \nsustainable joint capability to the joint warfighter.  The operational sponsor is the \nsubmitting organization (“has the problem”).  The technical sponsor is the organization \nthat has the expertise in designing and executing the experiment or expertise with the \nproposed capability.  The implementation sponsor is the organization that has the \nauthorities and responsibilities required for implementation of the developed capability, \nonce validated and approved, into the joint force.  These roles and responsibilities are \nidentified in a project experimentation support agreement during the planning phase and \nserve as the baseline for formal periodic project reviews and ensure that assessment \nremains relevant to DOD.  \n(2)  Joint assessment does not conclude the joint force development life cycle; it \ninforms it.  Being that the joint force development life cycle is iterative, constant, and \ninclusive, results of assessments provide validated solutions that provide change \nrecommendations for relevant joint doctrine, education, training, and exercises to sustain \nthe joint warfighter’s capability.  Additionally, as new capabilities are discovered through \nthe collection and exploration of lessons learned, joint warfighting capability is created \nwith the codification of these best practices into joint doctrine, the dissemination of lessons \nlearned across the Services, and comprehensive training and education programs that \nproduce our future strategists and leaders.  Accordingly, joint force development enables a \njoint trained and adaptable force	Federation of American Scientists
america_doctrine_188	America		prepared to function across the ROMO. \nFor further guidance on joint concepts and experimentation, refer to CJCSI 3010.02C, \nJoint Concept Development and Experimentation.  \n \n \nChapter VI \nVI-12 \nJP 1 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIntentionally Blank \n \n \nA-1 \nAPPENDIX A \nESTABLISHING DIRECTIVE (SUPPORT RELATIONSHIP) \nCONSIDERATIONS \n1.  General \nThe following information is provided to assist CCDRs, subordinate JFCs, and other \ncommanders with the authority to designate a support relationship between subordinate \ncommanders and with considerations in developing an establishing directive to clarify that \nsupport relationship. \n2.  Establishing Directive \na.  An establishing directive is essential to ensure unity of command.  Normally, the \ndesignated commander will develop a draft establishing directive during the planning phase \nto provide the specifics of the support relationship.  The commander will submit the draft \nestablishing directive to the establishing authority for consideration.  The establishing \ndirective is normally issued to specify the purpose of the support relationship, the effects \ndesired, the objectives, and the scope of the action to be taken.  It may also include but is \nnot necessarily limited to the following: \n(1)  Time, place, level, and duration of the supporting effort. \n(2)  Relative priority of the supporting effort. \n(3)  Authority, if any, of the supporting commanders to modify the supporting \neffort in the event of exceptional opportunity or an emergency. \n(4)  Degree of authority granted to the supported commander over the supporting \neffort.  \n(5)  Establishment of air, maritime, ground, and cyberspace maneuver control \nmeasures. \n(6)  Development of joint TACAIR strike requests and air support requests. \n(7)  Development of target nominations, establishment of fire support \ncoordination measures, integration of air defense, and the role of coordination centers.   \n(8)  Development of the current enemy situation,	Federation of American Scientists
america_doctrine_189	America		joint intelligence preparation of \nthe operational environment to guide the joint operation planning process, intelligence \ncollection plan, and ISR strategy.   \n(9)  Nonorganic logistic support.   \n(10)  Force protection responsibilities. \nAppendix A \nA-2 \nJP 1 \nb.  Unless otherwise stated in the establishing directive, the supported and supporting \ncommanders will identify the events and conditions for any shifts of the support \nrelationship throughout the operation during the planning phase and forward them to the \nestablishing authority for approval.  The establishing authority will resolve any differences \namong the commanders. \n3.  Supported Commander \nA supported commander may be designated for the entire operation, a particular phase \nor stage of the operation, a particular function, or a combination of phases, stages, events, \nand functions.  Unless limited by the establishing directive, the supported commander \nhas the authority to exercise general direction of the supporting effort.  General \ndirection includes the designation and prioritization of targets or objectives, timing and \nduration of the supporting action, and other instructions necessary for coordination and \nefficiency.  The establishing authority is responsible for ensuring that the supported and \nsupporting commanders understand the degree of authority that the supported commander \nis granted. \na.  If not specified, the establishing authority (the common superior commander) will \ndetermine who has primary responsibility for the essential tasks during the mission analysis \nin the planning process. \nb.  In an operation of relatively short duration, normally the establishing \nauthority will choose one supported commander for the entire operation. \n4.  Supporting Commander \nThe supporting commander determines the forces, tactics, methods, procedures, and \ncommunications to be employed in providing this support.  The supporting commander \nwill advise and coordinate with the supported commander	Federation of American Scientists
america_doctrine_190	America		on matters concerning the \nemployment and limitations (e.g., logistics) of such support, assist in planning for the \nintegration of such support into the supported commander’s effort as a whole, and ensure \nthat support requirements are appropriately communicated throughout the supporting \ncommander’s organization.  The supporting commander has the responsibility to ascertain \nthe needs of the supported force and take full action to fulfill them within existing \ncapabilities, consistent with priorities and requirements of other assigned tasks.  When the \nsupporting commander cannot fulfill the needs of the supported commander, the \nestablishing authority will be notified by either the supported or supporting commanders.  \nThe establishing authority is responsible for determining a solution. \n \n \nB-1 \nAPPENDIX B \nTHE PROFESSION OF ARMS \n1.  General \na.  A professional is a person of both character and competence.  As military \nprofessionals charged with the defense of the Nation, joint leaders must be experts in the \nconduct of war.  They must be moral individuals both of action and of intellect, skilled at \ngetting things done, while at the same time conversant in the military art. \nb.  Every joint leader is expected to be a student of the art and science of war.  Officers \nespecially are expected to have a solid foundation in military theory and philosophy, and \nknowledge of military history and the timeless lessons to be gained from it.  Leaders must \nhave a strong sense of the great responsibility of their office; the resources they will expend \nin war include their fellow citizens. \nc.  Strong character and competence represent the essence of the US joint military \nforce and its leaders.  Both are the products of lifelong learning and are embedded in JPME. \n2.  Character and Competence \na.  Character refers to the aggregate of features and traits that form the individual \nnature of a person.  In the context of the profession of arms, it entails moral and ethical	Federation of American Scientists
america_doctrine_191	America		adherence to our values.  Character is at the heart of the relationship of the profession with \nthe American people, and to each other.   \nb.  Competence is central to the profession of arms.  Competent performance includes \nboth the technical competence to perform the relevant task to standard as well as the ability \nto integrate that skill with others.  Those who will lead joint operations must develop skill \nin integrating forces into smoothly functioning joint teams. \nc.  Values of Joint Service.  US military service is based on values that US military \nexperience has proven to be vital for operational success.  These values adhere to the most \nidealistic societal norms, are common to all the Services, and represent the essence of \nmilitary professionalism.  Integrity, competence, physical courage, moral courage, and \nteamwork all have special impact on the conduct of joint operations. \n3.  Values \na.  US military service is based on values that US military experience has proven to be \nvital for operational success.  These values adhere to the most idealistic societal norms, are \ncommon to all the Services, and represent the essence of military professionalism.  Duty, \nhonor, courage, integrity, and selfless service are the calling cards of the profession of \narms. \n \n(1)  Duty is our foremost value.  It binds us together and conveys our moral \ncommitment or obligation as defenders of the Constitution and servants of the Nation.  As \nAppendix B \nB-2 \nJP 1 \nmembers of the profession of arms, we fulfill our duty without consideration of self-\ninterest, sacrificing our lives if needed.  From duty comes responsibility. \n \n(2)  Honor is the code of behavior that defines the ethical fulfillment of our duties.  \nIt is that quality that guides us to exemplify the ultimate in ethical and moral behavior; \nnever to lie, cheat, or steal; to abide by an uncompromising code of integrity; to respect \nhuman dignity; to have respect and concern for each other.  The quality of	Federation of American Scientists
america_doctrine_192	America		maturity; \ndedication, trust, and dependability that commits members of the profession of arms to act \nresponsibly; to be accountable for actions; to fulfill obligations; and to hold others \naccountable for their actions.  \n \n(3)  Courage. The United States of America is blessed with Soldiers, Marines, \nSailors, Airmen, and Coast Guardsmen whose courage knows no boundaries.  Even in \nwarfare characterized by advanced technology, individual fighting spirit and courage \nremain essential.  Courage has both physical and moral aspects and encompasses both \nbravery and fortitude.    \n \n(a)  Physical courage has throughout history defined warriors.  It is the \nability to confront physical pain, hardship, death, or threat of death.  Physical courage in a \nleader is most often expressed in a willingness to act, even alone if necessary, in situations \nof danger and uncertainty. \n \n(b)  Moral courage is the ability to act rightly in the face of popular \nopposition, or discouragement.  This includes the willingness to stand up for what one \nbelieves to be right even if that stand is unpopular or contrary to conventional wisdom.  \nThis involves risk taking, tenacity, and accountability.   \n \n(4)  Integrity is the quality of being honest and having strong moral principles.  \nIntegrity is the bedrock of our character and the cornerstone for building trust.  Trust is an \nessential trait among Service members—trust by seniors in the abilities of their \nsubordinates and by juniors in the competence and support of their seniors.  American \nService members must be able to rely on each other, regardless of the challenge at hand; \nthey must individually and collectively say what they mean, and do what they say.   \n \n(5)  Selfless service epitomizes the quality of putting our Nation, our military \nmission(s), and others before ourselves.  Members of the profession of arms do not serve \nto pursue fame, position, or money.  They give of themselves for the greater good.  Selfless \nservice is	Federation of American Scientists
america_doctrine_193	America		the enabler of teamwork, the cooperative effort by the members of a group to \nachieve common goals.   \n \nb.  Members of the Armed Forces of the United States must internalize and embody \nthese values of the profession of arms; their adherence to these values helps promulgate an \nattitude about joint warfighting, producing a synergy that multiplies the effects of their \nindividual actions. \n \n \n \nThe Profession of Arms \nB-3 \n4.  Teamwork \n \na.  The Armed Forces of the United States—every military organization to the lowest \nlevel—are a team.  Deterring adversaries and winning the Nation’s wars are the team’s \ncommon goals.   \n \n(1)  Trust and confidence are central to unity of effort.  A highly effective team is \nbased on the team members having trust and confidence in each other.     \n \n(2)  Successful teamwork requires delegation of authority commensurate with \nresponsibility.  This is a necessary part of building and maintaining the trust based on \ncompetence that characterizes the successful team.  Delegation unleashes the best efforts \nand greatest initiative among all members of military teams. \n \n(3)  Successful teamwork also requires cooperation.  While this aspect of teamwork \ncan be at tension with competition, and both are central human characteristics, the nature \nof modern warfare puts a premium on cooperation within the team in order to prevail.   \n \nFor additional details on the military profession and values, see the Chairman’s white \npaper, America’s Military—A Profession of Arms. \n \n \nAppendix B \nB-4 \nJP 1 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIntentionally Blank \n \n \nC-1 \nAPPENDIX C \nREFERENCES \nThe development of JP 1 is based upon the following primary references. \n1.

As a result, most bases and air \nassets were positioned close to the Pakistani border. 6 \nIn other words, until the last decade, India has lacked a conventional deterrent \ncapability and the type of reach that would allow New Delhi to engage in power \nprojection, should the need arise. In view of the observation that half a century’s \nworth of experience seemed not to influence Indian airpower thinking much be­\nyond tactical effect, it is interesting to note that the last serious exchange between \nIndia and Pakistan during the Kargil War in 1999 appears to have galvanized In­\ndian thinking about the role of airpower. Events since 9/11 and the rise of China \nhave also compelled India to rethink conventional deterrence and redefine security \nwell beyond India’s borders and territorial waters. This can be seen as a response to \nChinese behaviors, in particular. For the last decade, China’s air strategy defines \nstrategic frontiers well beyond its own borders.7 However, the major step change in \nIndia’s defense posture occurred most markedly after the Kargil War, and one of \nthe most striking features of this change is the way in which airpower is viewed—\nboth as a strategic instrument and as a decisive instrument in its own right. It is, \ntherefore, worth examining the Kargil conflict briefly in order to understand why \nit exercised such influence over Indian thinking.\nFall 2018 | 23\nRealignment and Indian Airpower Doctrine\nFor more than two months during 1999, Indian and Pakistani forces waged an \nintense conflict on the Indian side of the Line of Control (LOC) separating the \ntwo nations in Kashmir.8 Outside of the Indian subcontinent, it was a little known \nwar, mainly because the West’s attention was focused on the Kosovo conflict, \nwhich occurred at the same time. During March and April 1999, units of the Pak­\nistani Army infiltrated the Indian region of Kashmir by stealth.	Dr. Christina Goulter, Prof. Harsh Pant - airuniversity.af.edu

The withdrawal of Indian troops \nseemed to the Pakistanis too good an opportunity to miss, and although never of­\nficially stated at the time, the Pakistani aim was to seize control of India’s only land \nline of communication to the Siachen Glacier, at the top end of the LOC, adjacent \nto the Chinese border.10 By the beginning of May, Pakistani forces occupied some \n130 outposts, along a front of 112 miles, to a depth of 5–6 miles on the Indian \nside of the LOC. Conservative estimates at the time suggested that this involved \nan occupation force of between 1,500–2,000 Pakistani troops.11 \nThe Pakistani invasion became apparent only during the first week of May, \nwhen the Indian Army units that had withdrawn from their outposts and observa­\ntion points a few months earlier started to return. At first, the initial assessment \nwas that Pakistani troops had occupied only a handful of posts and that the incur­\nsions could be dealt with by a local unit response within a few days.12 However, \nfollowing artillery and small arms exchanges with Pakistani units, it became appar­\nent that repelling the invaders would require a coherent response, and the IAF was \ncalled upon to support Indian Army battalions in the Kargil zone. As attack heli­\ncopters were unable to operate at the high altitudes involved, the IAF had to em­\nploy jet aircraft for reconnaissance and attack. During the third week of May, five \ninfantry divisions, five brigades, and 44 battalions were dispatched to the Kargil \nsector, totaling more than 200,000 troops, and an Indian counteroffensive was \nplanned for 26 May.13	Dr. Christina Goulter, Prof. Harsh Pant - airuniversity.af.edu
india_Air_doctrine_4	India	Air	The time elapsed between the first official acknowledgment of the Pakistani in­\ncursion and the counteroffensive was characterized by vacillation by senior Indian \nmilitary leadership as to the nature of the threat posed, dogmatism on the part of \nArmy commanders as to how they were going to meet the challenge (specifically, \nthe type of air support they wanted), and fears over escalation of the conflict.14 \n24 | Journal of Indo-Pacific Affairs\nGoulter & Pant\nThere can be little doubt that the scale of the Pakistani incursion caused a strategic \nshock. Although artillery exchanges in the Kargil sector had increased in frequency \nover the preceding two years, the region was considered a quiet zone in compari­\nson with others along the LOC. For the first two weeks of May, many senior com­\nmanders refused to believe that the incursion was performed by anyone other than \nmilitant insurgents, and briefings continued to refer to mujahedeen. The Indian \nArmy persisted in its belief that it was markedly stronger and more capable than \nthe Pakistanis, so the realization, when it finally came, that India had suffered a \nmajor incursion caused considerable psychological dislocation—not just at local \nunit level but, most significantly, among the senior military leadership.15 This dis­\nlocation manifested itself in a number of ways, not least in a lack of a joint re­\nsponse from the Indian armed forces. The initial reports were kept within Army \ncircles, and as late as the morning of 10 May, the IAF’s Western Air Command \nstill knew nothing about the incursion. The only air support that was requested in \nthe early stages was at a local level, when calls were made for helicopter gunships. \nWhen it was pointed out by the local air commander that attack helicopters would \nbe extremely vulnerable to ground fire, especially Pakistani surface-to-air missiles \n(SAM), the Army vice-chief insisted that fast jet aviation would be inappropriate \nand potentially escalatory.

Although no Indian air­\ncraft were lost to enemy fire after this point, the SAM threat remained high, and \nthe Pakistanis fired more than 100 SAMs in the course of the conflict. Exacerbat­\ning the problems facing the aircrews was the paucity of intelligence. Not only had \nthere been a lack of joint air-land planning but the Army had also failed to pass on \nthe latest intelligence assessments of Pakistani strengths and dispositions. Much of \nthe intelligence being used by the IAF during the first weeks of the campaign was \nFall 2018 | 25\nRealignment and Indian Airpower Doctrine\nderived from its own aerial reconnaissance. In contrast to the Army’s own organic \naviation reconnaissance, which failed to detect any Pakistani activity in the previ­\nous months, the IAF’s imagery analysis had at least shown where most of the Paki­\nstani dispositions were, and electronic surveillance of the area provided useful sig­\nnals intelligence (SIGINT), in spite of the Pakistani’s increased signals security.20 \n The most significant aerial action in support of the Indian 3rd and 8th Moun­\ntain Divisions occurred	Dr. Christina Goulter, Prof. Harsh Pant - airuniversity.af.edu
india_Air_doctrine_6	India	Air	during the first two weeks of June. In order to prevent the \nPakistan Air Force (PAF) from interfering with the fighting on the ground and In­\ndian air support, the IAF maintained combat air patrols along the full length of \nthe LOC and the Indo-Pakistani border, more widely.21 This was done as a precau­\ntion in case of a rapid escalation of the conflict. By this point, there was close coor­\ndination between the IAF and the Indian Army, and almost all the actions on the \nground were preceded by air strikes. To begin with, the IAF was employing un­\nguided weapons, but because of the problems with targeting in the mountainous \nterrain, the IAF quickly employed Mirage 2000H aircraft, which were capable of \ndelivering laser-guided weapons. The change to precision weapons played a signifi­\ncant role in swinging the campaign in India’s favor, and by mid-June, the Indian \nmountain divisions had recaptured the high ground that gave direct line of sight \nonto the national highway to the north. Another significant aerial action occurred \non 17 June, when IAF Mirages hit the Pakistanis’ main administrative and logistics \nhub at Muntho Dhalo, causing not just physical destruction but also dealing a ma­\njor blow to Pakistani morale. Pakistani reports show that this attack marked the \nturning point in their campaign, as they were unable to sustain their operations \nafter this point. As the weeks passed, the Indian mountain divisions recaptured \none post after another, and the only occasions on which air support was not pro­\nvided was when the weather precluded flying operations. Some strike operations \nwere done at night, which also added to the psychological pressure being applied \nto the Pakistanis, who had not anticipated round-the-clock air attacks. Air strikes \nended in mid-July, but other air support continued. This included several thou­\nsand helicopter sorties engaged in troop movement, air resupply, casualty evacua­\ntion, and heavy lift provided by Antinov-32 transport	Dr. Christina Goulter, Prof. Harsh Pant - airuniversity.af.edu

The Pakistanis \nwere unable to match this level of sustainment and reinforcement, and, by 26 July, \nIndian forces had recaptured most of the posts, and almost all Pakistani units had \nwithdrawn to their side of the LOC. The Indian counteroffensive had cost the \nArmy 471 killed and a further 1,060 wounded.22 The Pakistani casualties were \n26 | Journal of Indo-Pacific Affairs\nGoulter & Pant\nsubstantially more: over 700 killed and an estimated 1,000 wounded. Some \nsources suggest that these official Pakistani figures underplay the total losses by sev­\neral hundred.23 It is worth noting that, in spite of the difficulties the IAF experi­\nenced in targeting, there were no “blue-on-blue” incidents during the campaign, \nand the application of airpower had been both precise and proportionate.\nIn the decade that followed the Kargil War, the conflict became the subject for \nextensive study in both India and Pakistan and was seen as a watershed.24 It was \nrecognized as a unique conflict, not least because the two antagonists were nuclear-\narmed nations. Pakistan’s acquisition of nuclear weapons in 1998 had made the \ncountry bolder in its dealings with India, but both nations came away from the \nconflict impressed (and relieved) that they had succeeded in preventing a nuclear \nescalation. Up to that point, the accepted orthodoxy within Western political and \nmilitary circles was that nuclear-armed adversaries would avoid conflict at all costs \nfor fear of escalation to a nuclear level.25 The Kargil War defied that orthodoxy. \nThe failure of the nuclear deterrent in this case prompted a rethinking of nuclear \ndoctrine, but the conflict also spawned a new limited war concept, especially as far \nas India was concerned.26 For India, Kargil demonstrated that it was possible to \nengage in a limited conventional conflict without escalation to the nuclear level, \nand this hurriedly prompted India	Dr. Christina Goulter, Prof. Harsh Pant - airuniversity.af.edu
india_Air_doctrine_8	India	Air	to pursue the build-up of conventional forces \nin order to maintain its military-strategic advantage over Pakistan. As part of that \ndesire to dominate escalation in a conflict, India looked to airpower to provide the \nprincipal strategic advantage, and this posture was very clear from a number of ac­\ntions and pronouncements made by IAF seniors.27 Interestingly, the Pakistani anal­\nysis of the consequences of Kargil also drew a clear connection between the con­\nflict and the IAF’s modernization program. One PAF senior officer asserted that \nthe Kargil review report provided the basis for the IAF receiving the preponder­\nance of the 15-year defense spending plan (i.e. about $30 billion) for new multi­\nrole aircraft, including the Sukhoi Su-30MKI and French Rafale, as well as new \ntransport aircraft and an enhanced airborne early warning capability.28\nDoctrinal Evolution\nIndia’s intent to dominate conflict escalation is also reflected in its 2012 airpower \ndoctrine. What differentiates this doctrine from its predecessor (published in 1995) \nis that it goes beyond outlining merely what airpower is, in terms of its roles, and \nexplains to a far greater extent what airpower is for.29 In contrast to the previous \nIAF doctrine, and, indeed, most Western airpower doctrine, the 2012 version \nFall 2018 | 27\nRealignment and Indian Airpower Doctrine\nmakes a much clearer connection between airpower and national security. Airpower \nis viewed as an indicator of national power and is defined as comprising the “sum \ntotal of a nation’s aviation and related capabilities,” including civilian assets.30 The \ninclusion of civilian assets is unusual in doctrinal terms, but it demonstrates that \nthe IAF is now thinking in a holistic way about national capability. Airpower is seen \nas serving Indian national interests across the full spectrum of conflict as well as tak­\ning a leading role in nation building and military diplomacy.\nHowever, perhaps the most unique conceptual work is	Dr. Christina Goulter, Prof. Harsh Pant - airuniversity.af.edu
india_Air_doctrine_9	India	Air	displayed in the areas of \ncontrol of the air and strategic effect.31 Control of the air is seen not merely as the \nmost fundamental role of airpower (to protect the nation-state from attack) and a \nvital prerequisite for all other operations but also as the capability to defend a na­\ntion and provide freedom of maneuver as a deterrent in itself. This is a very impor­\ntant point overlooked in most other airpower doctrine. The IAF doctrine does not \ngo as far as some previous British airpower doctrine, which suggests that control of \nthe air is “an end in itself”; the argument the IAF puts forward is far more nu­\nanced.32 It sees deterrence and control of the air as inextricably intertwined; the \ncredibility of the air force is dependent upon the ability of that air force to maintain \ncontrol of the air, but the ability to control the airspace means little if the deterrent \nvalue of the air force is limited. The phrase deterrent air defense encapsulates what \nis intended.\nIt is also interesting to note that the IAF has retained the old doctrinal nomencla­\nture of degrees of control of the air.33 This has been dispensed with in most Western \nair doctrine over the last decade and a half, coinciding with COIN campaigning, \nduring which time there has been little threat from the air. However, it is under \nconsideration again now that state threats have come back into focus and the West \nis having to operate in parts of the world where air defense is well developed and \nde-confliction among various national air contingents may not be thoroughly \nworked out. The 2011 air campaign over Libya and recent operations against the \nIslamic State in Syria are good examples of this.34 During the Kargil operation, the \nIAF maintained air superiority adjacent to most of the LOC, but a persistent threat \nposed by SAMs meant that the IAF did not have air supremacy. The IAF’s control \nof the air was not absolute, but it possessed sufficient control in order to prosecute \nthe campaign it	Dr. Christina Goulter, Prof. Harsh Pant - airuniversity.af.edu
india_Air_doctrine_10	India	Air	wished in order to dislodge the invaders.\nThere are several other aspects of control of the air that have been downplayed or \nomitted in Western doctrine since the end of the Cold War but feature in the latest \nIAF doctrine. One of these is protection of airfields. The IAF doctrine notes that \n28 | Journal of Indo-Pacific Affairs\nGoulter & Pant\nairfields are “densely packed, high-value targets. Aircraft on the ground at airfields \nare more concentrated and vulnerable than they are in flight.”35 With considerable \nprescience, these lines were written just prior to the major Taliban attack on Camp \nBastion, Afghanistan, in September 2012, which resulted in the loss of two US ser­\nvicemen and several aircraft, prompting the US and Britain to re-examine existing \ntactics and resuscitate old Cold War survival-to-operate procedures.36 However, the \npoint is that it should not have taken the attack on Camp Bastion to draw attention \nto force protection issues. Since the end of the Cold War, several NATO nations \nhave had experiences of bases being attacked. During the closing stages of the con­\nflict in Iraq, for example, British Royal Air Force (RAF) aircraft came increasingly \nunder attack in Basra, causing the larger assets (such as the Nimrod maritime patrol \naircraft) to be withdrawn further back in theatre, and during 2007, the RAF lost a \nC-130 Hercules after an improvised explosive device detonated on the airfield at Al-\nAmarah. In both of these cases, the lesson supposedly learned was that no freedom \nof maneuver meant no airpower effect, or, at least, delayed airpower effect. One of \nthe reasons why such incidents seem not to have had much impact in the United \nKingdom may be because force protection is not addressed directly in the latest \nBritish airpower doctrine but is dealt with in subordinate operations manuals writ­\nten by the RAF Regiment. These manuals convey the importance of force protec­\ntion in a manner that should appear, at least briefly, in the	Dr. Christina Goulter, Prof. Harsh Pant - airuniversity.af.edu

india_Air_doctrine_11	India	Air	main airpower doctrine. \nFor instance, the RAF Force Protection for Air Operations manual refers to the way \nin which force protection “is recognized, along with Air Logistics, as a key enabler \nfor Air and Space Power’s four fundamental roles.”37 This is one of several areas \nwhere the IAF airpower doctrine is superior because it acknowledges that control of \nthe air includes protection of aircraft on the ground in the face of surface-to-surface \nthreats.\nHowever, the main reason the IAF doctrine has attracted attention in the West, \nparticularly in the United States, is its treatment of strategic effect and conventional \ndeterrence. The US interest stems from the fact that it is seeking to partner with na­\ntions that it regards as counterbalances to China, but it is also related to a new US \nfocus on tailored deterrence using nuclear and conventional means.38 In India, dis­\ncussions of strategic effect preceded the Kargil conflict, and, indeed, the subject ap­\npeared briefly in the previous IAF doctrine, but the conflict in 1999 prompted far \ngreater consideration of airpower’s strategic role, not the least because it helped to \ndefuse a potential nuclear escalation. During the early to mid-2000s, many writers, \nseveral of whom were recently retired senior officers, underscored the importance of \nFall 2018 | 29\nRealignment and Indian Airpower Doctrine\nairpower in turning the tide during the Kargil conflict and how airpower provided \nthe best means of ensuring that India attains its place as a global player economi­\ncally.39 As far as India is concerned, the principal threat to this aspiration comes \nfrom China. Although Indo-Chinese relations improved for a time during the late \n1990s, military competition and distrust remain. China engaged in what were con­\nsidered to be several provocative actions during the following decade, including the \nbuilding of SIGINT installations in the southern portion of the Tibetan plateau \nand in Aksai Chin, a disputed border area	Dr. Christina Goulter, Prof. Harsh Pant - airuniversity.af.edu
india_Air_doctrine_12	India	Air	between the two countries. Chinese rapid \nreaction forces were also deployed close to the border. As a result, the IAF strength­\nened its Eastern Air Command, deploying Su30 Flankers there from 2008 onward. \nThe commander of the Eastern Air Force at the time, Air Marshal Pranab Kumar \nBarbora, made the point that this reinforcement was designed to thwart any “mis­\nadventure” by the Chinese and a repeat of the 1962 conflict. While it was admitted \nthat India could not match China’s numerical strength, it was felt that the IAF \nwould provide a sufficiently strong “deterrent force” because of its force multiplying \npotential.40  \nSo, while India sees Pakistan as a constant drain on its defense resources because \nof the ongoing territorial claims, the rise of China has eclipsed most other security \nconcerns. Whereas India’s concept of defense used to focus purely on its borders, it \nnow envisages “strategic reach” to protect national interests, particularly economic, \ntrade, and energy security.41 Implicit in this strategic reach is deterrence; India is no \nlonger content to fight purely within its own borders when threatened and now \ntalks in terms of protecting its security interests at a continental level and extending \nits range also in the maritime sphere from the Persian Gulf to the Straits of Ma­\nlacca.42\nThis emphasis on strategic reach and strategic effect, more broadly, is a funda­\nmental revolution in how India views airpower and is reflected in both the 2012 \nIAF doctrine and procurement. After half a century of viewing the IAF as a tactical \nsupport instrument, the 2012 doctrine seems to go almost to the opposite extreme. \nIt states “air power is inherently strategic in nature and its tactical application would \nonly fritter away its prime advantage of creating strategic effects.”43 Interestingly, the \ndoctrine makes a point of quoting some of Marshal of the RAF Lord Hugh \nTrenchard’s pronouncements from the 1920s, “It is not necessary for an air force, in	Dr. Christina Goulter, Prof. Harsh Pant - airuniversity.af.edu

Air power can dis­\npense with that intermediate step, can pass over the enemy navies and armies, pen­\n30 | Journal of Indo-Pacific Affairs\nGoulter & Pant\netrate the air defences and attack direct the centres of production, transportation \nand communication from which the enemy war effort is maintained.”44\nBut just when the new doctrine could appear to be a throwback to the extreme \npositions of the interwar theorists, it then offers some unique insights about the na­\nture of strategic effect and serves to demonstrate where Western airpower doctrine is \nconceptually weak. One of these areas is the definition of strategic air effect. The \nIAF document makes the point that “the classification of an offensive air operation \nas ‘strategic’ is not determined by range, platform type or the weaponry used, but is \ndetermined by the objective or the purpose served.”45 Much of Western airpower \ndoctrine continues to conflate range or depth of penetration with “strategic.” For \nexample, the latest British airpower doctrine talks about strategic being the effect \nsought, yet it also refers to operations against targets in the “heart of enemy terri­\ntory.”46 \nHowever, one of the most important observations made by the IAF doctrine \nabout the nature of strategic effect can be found in a section on sub-conventional \noperations. One of the fallacies in Western discourse, especially since 2001, is that \nairpower is a purely supporting instrument in irregular warfare, and that airpower \ncannot have strategic effect in this setting.47 Although the 2012 IAF doctrine could \nhave expanded on this area a little more, it makes the point that key leadership tar­\ngeting has a strategic effect.48 It uses the US operation to kill Osama bin Laden in \nMay 2011 to illustrate airpower’s role in sub-conventional warfare, but a better ex­\nample might have been the targeting of the Al-Qaeda in Iraq (AQI) leader Abu \nMusab al-Zarqawi in	Dr. Christina Goulter, Prof. Harsh Pant - airuniversity.af.edu
india_Air_doctrine_14	India	Air	2006, which included airborne tracking of al-Zarqawi and the \nfinal act performed by F-16s.\nReflecting India’s new interest in protecting its global interests and defending for­\nward, the 2012 doctrine also devotes space to strategic lift. The doctrine and senior \nIAF commentators make the point that a strategic strike capability without strategic \nairlift risks a gap in India’s ability to project power.49 Doubtless, the Kargil experi­\nence was informative here, as airlift was used to bring several divisions into the zone \nprior to the Indian counteroffensive, but airlift has been viewed as a lifeline to In­\ndian forces in the border zones for over 50 years.50 However, it is also apparent that \nthe IAF sees strategic airlift as important for soft power, including humanitarian aid \nand disaster relief in the region. Reference is made in several places throughout the \ndoctrine to airpower’s role in non-kinetic activity, and a whole chapter is devoted to \n“Nation Building, Aerial Diplomacy and Perception Management.”51 Western air­\nFall 2018 | 31\nRealignment and Indian Airpower Doctrine\npower doctrine, in contrast, has tended to emphasize kinetic effect when addressing \nstrategic airpower. This is particularly the case with US doctrine.52  \nIndia’s aspiration to achieve power projection and an expeditionary capability is \nnot yet a reality, and some writers cast doubt on the idea that India can achieve a \ntrue expeditionary footing, even in the midterm.53 The IAF has many legacy assets, \nwith a preponderance of short-range interceptor aircraft, such as the MiG-21, \nwhich were given multirole functions during the 1980s and 1990s. The short range \nof the aircraft concerned meant that the IAF could only perform air defense and \nArmy-support functions.54 However, the IAF’s modernization program is making \nsteady progress toward a strength of 42 squadrons by 2022, and the types of aircraft \nbeing procured indicate a serious intent to develop a balanced air force and a true	Dr. Christina Goulter, Prof. Harsh Pant - airuniversity.af.edu
india_Air_doctrine_15	India	Air	strategic capability.55 Three combat aircraft acquisition programs aim to provide a \nnew light combat aircraft (an indigenous design, the Tejas) to replace the aging \nMiG-21s, a multirole combat fighter (the French Rafale), and a fifth-generation \nfighter (the Su-T50 being developed in collaboration with the Russians). Although \nthe introduction of the Tejas has been slower than desired, the IAF expressed satis­\nfaction with its performance as a light multirole strike aircraft during recent exer­\ncises.56 In addition, the IAF is acquiring a fleet of 272 Su-30 fighter-bombers, Israeli \nairborne early warning aircraft, and air transport aircraft from the United States (in­\ncluding six C-130J Hercules, air-to-air refueling aircraft, and an unspecified num­\nber of C-17 Globemasters).57 These acquisitions will have not just force multiplier \neffects but synergies that will add to the deterrent value of the IAF. Early warning \naircraft will not only enhance India’s air defense radius but will also play a key role \nin any expeditionary context. Similarly, refueling tanker aircraft will increase the \nrange and weapon loads of strike aircraft, thereby adding to India’s air deterrent.\nChallenges Facing Indian Airpower\nWhile greater thought is being applied as to how these aircraft are being ac­\nquired, one of the key weaknesses of the IAF has been the multiplicity of aircraft \ntypes in service. During the 1980s, for example, the IAF had no fewer than 11 dif­\nferent fighter aircraft, and this placed an unnecessary training and maintenance \nburden on the service.58 There may still be problems if the current modernization \nprogram persists with multinational procurement, not the least because the United \nStates’ increasingly strained relations with Russia may affect India’s relationship \nwith those two countries. After decades of deliberately pursuing a non-aligned \nposture, India has cultivated much closer ties with the United States, including \n32 | Journal of Indo-Pacific	Dr. Christina Goulter, Prof. Harsh Pant - airuniversity.af.edu

However, there remains one serious impediment to India’s desire for global \nreach and power projection—a flawed intelligence apparatus. Sharing of intelli­\ngence between the military and intelligence agencies remains suboptimal, and In­\ndia currently lacks a command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, \ninformation, surveillance, and reconnaissance (C4I2SR) system suitable for net­\nwork-centric warfare.60 While India made a variety of important observations \nabout the Kargil conflict, chief of which was the deficiencies in the Indian intel­\nligence apparatus, not all the lessons identified were acted upon or received further \nattention.61 This is evident in several places, not the least the 2012 IAF doctrine, \nLt Col Casey Eaton, USAF, explains the capabilities of the C-17 Globemaster III to Indian air force wing commanders Anup Kumar Dutta, K.V. \nSurendran Nair, and S.K.

This is in contrast to most Western airpower \ndoctrine, which treats intelligence acquisition as one of the four main roles of air­\npower and how strategic effect, in particular, is dependent upon all-source analy­\nsis.63 Even allowing for Indian sensitivities over releasing too much information \nabout their intelligence machinery, to accord the subject just a few lines is a serious \nweakness in the doctrine. Other nations’ airpower doctrine manages to address in­\ntelligence in generic terms, without compromising national security, and the IAF \nshould be able to do the same. \nIn the past, when countries have suffered strategic shock as a result of perceived \nor actual intelligence failure, not only is the intelligence apparatus overhauled but \nalso the significance of accurate and timely intelligence is usually impressed upon \nall organs of state, especially the military.64 For the IAF doctrine to downplay the \nrole of intelligence is not just dangerous, it is an oddity, because one of the conclu­\nsions drawn in the Kargil report was that India’s national surveillance capability \nwas “grossly inadequate,” particularly satellite and other imagery acquisition.65 The \nreport states that had India possessed high-definition satellite imagery capability, \nunmanned aerial vehicles, and better human intelligence, the Pakistani incursion \nwould have been spotted at a much earlier point. The report recommended that \nevery effort be made and adequate funds provided to ensure that a capability of \nworld standards was developed “indigenously and put in place in the shortest pos­\nsible	Dr. Christina Goulter, Prof. Harsh Pant - airuniversity.af.edu

One of the possible reasons why the doctrine devotes \nso little attention to the subject is that airpower, itself, is accorded surprisingly lit­\ntle attention in the Kargil report. The report tends to focus on the failures by the \nIndian defense-and-security apparatus, rather than addressing any success stories. \nAs airpower was considered the principal factor explaining Indian success, it may \nhave been sidelined as a topic not demanding further investigation.67 If airpower \n34 | Journal of Indo-Pacific Affairs\nGoulter & Pant\nhad been found wanting, then it and air-derived intelligence may have been ad­\ndressed in more detail.\nNevertheless, the Kargil report does point to failings in service intelligence and \nsharing of intelligence among the services and intelligence agencies. Among the \nobservations made is that Indian air intelligence was lulled into a false sense of se­\ncurity. When Pakistani aircraft were located near the border just prior to the incur­\nsion, both army and air force intelligence assessed this activity as “normal.”68 \nEqually, reports of construction of helicopter bases were dismissed, as it was rea­\nsoned that the bases were required to support Pakistani positions near the LOC. \nHowever, both the air force and the army were criticized for shortcomings in or­\nder-of-battle analysis, especially their failure to keep track of five Pakistani light in­\nfantry battalions as they crossed the LOC.69 In several cases, tactical intelligence \nwas not shared beyond one-star headquarters, either within the same service or \nwith other services so that a holistic view of Pakistani activity impossible.70 How­\never, the failings did not just exist at unit level. The operational level intelligence \napparatus also came in for criticism when it became apparent that there	Dr. Christina Goulter, Prof. Harsh Pant - airuniversity.af.edu
india_Air_doctrine_19	India	Air	was some \ntactical intelligence suggesting that an invasion was imminent, but that the ana­\nlytical staffs compiling an overall assessment for the Director General of Military \nIntelligence overlooked this intelligence.71 Part of the problem seems to have \nstemmed from a classic intelligence pitfall: mirror imaging. Because the Indian \nArmy lacked the means to sustain operations in winter weather at altitude, the as­\nsumption was made that the Pakistanis would not attempt major military opera­\ntions in that type of environment.72  \nMany writers consider Kargil to have been a systemic intelligence failure,73 but \nthis may be doing a disservice to parts of the intelligence machinery that func­\ntioned reasonably well. It is worth noting on which occasions and at what levels \nthe intelligence apparatus made the correct assessments. There is a suggestion in \nthe Kargil report that the Indian Joint Intelligence Committee (JIC), which is re­\nsponsible for pan-government strategic assessments, did raise the possibility of a \nPakistani campaign in the Kargil zone in November 1998, some five months be­\nfore the incursion.74 The JIC also repeatedly pointed to an emboldened Pakistani \ngovernment that was likely to initiate a move in the Jammu and Kashmir region. \nThe Kargil report made the point that JIC assessments did not receive the atten­\ntion “they deserved at the political and higher bureaucratic levels. . . . The JIC was \nnot accorded the importance it deserved either by the intelligence agencies or the \nGovernment.”75 The question can be raised as to why the JIC’s assessments did not \nFall 2018 | 35\nRealignment and Indian Airpower Doctrine\ngain traction especially within the Indian government. The problem may have \nbeen the type of language used; assessments done by committee tend to reflect the \nlowest-common-denominator positions within the committee, leading to anodyne \nlanguage. It is, therefore, possible that the strategic indicators of an incursion by \nPakistan	Dr. Christina Goulter, Prof. Harsh Pant - airuniversity.af.edu
india_Air_doctrine_20	India	Air	were not conveyed robustly enough. But writers who suggest that no stra­\ntegic assessments had been made are wrong.76 Equally, after the incursion became \napparent, the IAF did perform well in reconnaissance and imagery analysis. One \nof the IAF’s strengths is its adaptability, and as early as 10 May, the IAF’s recon­\nnaissance-and-surveillance assets were swung into action, including Jaguar fighters \nemployed in a reconnaissance role.77 Air-derived intelligence helped to bring clar­\nity to the situation during the critical days after the incursion was first reported, \nand on 14 May, the Air HQ established an air operations center for the Jammu–\nKashmir region in anticipation of a counteroffensive.\nThe responsiveness that the IAF demonstrated was in spite of a lack of effective \njoint machinery. There was surprisingly little communication between the Land \nand Air HQs, and during the first week after the incursion was detected, the In­\ndian Army attempted to respond alone. The Air Chief Marshal Tipnis recalled how \nthe Army’s Northern Command was reluctant to share reports on its initial artil­\nlery and small arms exchanges with the Pakistani forces. When the Army did en­\ngage with the local air officer commanding, the request was for helicopter gunships \nto assist with the “eviction” of the “intruders.”78 It was pointed out that the alti­\ntudes at which air support would have to operate precluded the use of helicopters, \nand fast jet aviation was suggested as the only option, not least because if the situa­\ntion escalated, airpower was going to provide the best means of dealing with the \nsituation quickly. This was eventually agreed upon, after discussions between the \nservice chiefs, but valuable time was lost due to there being no formal process for \nair-land integration. Air Chief Marshal Tipnis commented that there was a total \nlack of Army-IAF joint staff work and no joint planning, not even joint delibera­\ntions at any command level, and this persisted for	Dr. Christina Goulter, Prof. Harsh Pant - airuniversity.af.edu
india_Air_doctrine_21	India	Air	several weeks.79 However, once \nthe gravity of the Pakistani incursion became known at the governmental level and \napproval for the use of fast jet aviation was received, with the caveat that the IAF \noperated on the Indian side of the LOC, jointery characterized India’s conduct of \nthe conflict.80 \n The IAF’s senior leadership was clearly scarred by the initial lack of service inte­\ngration during the Kargil conflict, and jointery is one of the areas that does receive \nclose attention in the 2012 doctrine (in contrast to intelligence). A whole chapter \n36 | Journal of Indo-Pacific Affairs\nGoulter & Pant\nis devoted to “Joint Operations,” and it provides almost unique clarity on the sub­\nject.81 Western airpower doctrine would do well to emulate it. One of the particu­\nlar strengths of the chapter is the way in which ideas are articulated; the language \nused is direct and very clear. The doctrine uses the word “jointmanship,” making it \na function of leadership. This is a vitally important point and a considerable ad­\nvance on most other doctrine. Second, it emphasizes that jointery is about true \npartnership and genuine respect for each service’s capabilities. The issue of respect \nis so often omitted in Western doctrine. It underscores mutual trust and confi­\ndence, as well as each service taking the time to learn and understand the strengths \nand weaknesses of other partners. The doctrine also emphasizes the importance of \nusing the appropriate tools at the right time. The issue of appropriateness is rarely \ndiscussed in Western doctrine. It is suggested that if all these factors are taken ac­\ncount of, then joint action will have synergistic and force multiplying effects, but \nthe point is also made that jointmanship needs to be exercised regularly, because \nthis is the only way to refine operating concepts. In short, this chapter articulates \nthe essential tenets of jointery in a way that is yet to be done properly in the West.\nAlthough some of the most unique	Dr. Christina Goulter, Prof. Harsh Pant - airuniversity.af.edu
india_Air_doctrine_22	India	Air	conceptual work found in the IAF doctrine \nrelates to control of the air and strategic effect, the way in which air-surface inte­\ngration is treated is also noteworthy.82 A number of important observations are \nmade, including the psychological effect of air attacks on enemy troops and the \nfact that air interdiction of enemy supply lines can create strategic effect (the ex­\nample cited in the latter case is Wehrmacht General Erwin Rommel’s Afrika Corps \nbeing unable to exercise any real impact on Mediterranean strategy after 1942 due \nto the aerial interdiction of his supply lines). During the Kargil conflict, the attack \non the Pakistani logistics hub at Muntho Dhalo dealt a fatal blow to both Paki­\nstani morale and their ability to sustain their campaign, and these effects were \nhighlighted in the Kargil report.83 Clearly, this experience had a major impact on \nIAF thinking about the psychological effect of airpower and the significance of aer­\nial interdiction.\nHowever, perhaps most interesting is the IAF doctrine’s treatment of air-mari­\ntime operations. Unusually, India employs its navy for maritime reconnaissance, \nbut the strike function has been given to the air force. Of particular note is the \nway in which a distinction is drawn between anti-shipping strike and maritime \nstrike.84 The former is aimed at the enemy’s naval assets in proximity to Indian \nforces, while the latter is aimed at enemy targets that are not in contact with \nfriendly forces, and included in this category are enemy naval facilities in harbor \nFall 2018 | 37\nRealignment and Indian Airpower Doctrine\nand maritime patrol aircraft on the ground. This distinction between anti-shipping \nstrike and maritime strike is unique and is akin to the distinction made in Western \nairpower doctrine between close air support (the targeting of enemy troops in con­\ntact with friendly forces) and air interdiction (the targeting of enemy supply lines, \nreserves, and troops not in the immediate	Dr. Christina Goulter, Prof. Harsh Pant - airuniversity.af.edu
india_Air_doctrine_23	India	Air	battlespace). The main point, however, \nis that the IAF doctrine dedicates far more space to this subject than most Western \nairpower doctrine, certainly the British equivalents since the 1990s, which have \nsteadily decreased the attention given to anti-shipping (or maritime strike) roles.85  \nWhat the authors of the Indian airpower doctrine appreciate, while their coun­\nterparts in the West seem not to, is that one of the roles of air doctrine is to high­\nlight how airpower should be used or could be used, if the nation possesses all the \nresources it requires. One of the traps into which British doctrine, in particular, \nhas fallen is to downplay or disregard certain functions of airpower when the \ncountry has lacked particular assets. This is certainly the case with maritime avia­\ntion. In the late 1990s, after the RAF dispensed with its two Tornado squadrons \ndevoted to an anti-shipping role, no mention was made of a maritime-strike func­\ntion in RAF doctrine.86 Similarly, the axing of the Nimrod maritime patrol aircraft \nafter the Strategic Defence Review of 2010 led to the maritime reconnaissance-\nand-surveillance function being dropped from the 2013 doctrine, just as strategic \neffect disappeared from British air doctrine in the fourth edition simply because \nthe operational context was, apparently, all about COIN warfare at the time. In \nother words, doctrine of any service type needs to deal in some universal constants \nand should not be overly swayed by either operational contexts or available capa­\nbilities. A certain proportion of any doctrine also has aspirational elements to it, \nand some of the IAF doctrine falls into this category. The IAF doctrine optimisti­\ncally predicts that air force and carrier aviation will be able to meet both regional \nand out-of-area defense requirements, so long as operations are properly coordi­\nnated and planned.87 \nConclusion\nIt is clear from the 2012 doctrine that the IAF sees itself as an instrument of \npower	Dr. Christina Goulter, Prof. Harsh Pant - airuniversity.af.edu
india_Air_doctrine_24	India	Air	projection and underpinning expeditionary capability, but it also recognizes \nthat it is the principal tool in India’s armory if deterrence fails.88 It is also clear that \nthe Kargil experience was extremely important in crystalizing Indian thinking \nabout the utility of airpower. For India, the overriding lessons from 1999 were that \nthe nation had paid a heavy price for its failure to invest properly in conventional \n38 | Journal of Indo-Pacific Affairs\nGoulter & Pant\ndeterrence, a balanced force structure and intelligence, but that airpower had been \nthe chief factor in turning the tide in its favor. Since then, Pakistan has been reluc­\ntant to engage in major adventurism (even if border skirmishes continue). There­\nfore, it is difficult to agree with some writers who suggest that the IAF’s expanded \ncapability is causing more, not less, instability in South Asia.89 The IAF’s modern­\nization program has been transformative, not merely in material and training \nterms but also in the conceptual realm. While some flaws in the airpower doctrine \nremain, not least in how intelligence is treated, the 2012 doctrine is revolutionary \non many levels. This transformation has ensured new, strong international partner­\nships that have, in turn, added to the deterrent value of the IAF. JIPA \n\nNotes\n1.       See, for example, Adam B.

If its current economic rise continues, China’s strategic \nposture and approach to war will be one of the key variables of international \npolitics. To make sense of China’s current foreign policy stance and potential \nfuture behavior regarding war, the following questions need to be answered: \nWhat military means, if necessary, would China employ in case of a war? \nWhere is a military threat to China likely to come from? What are the stra-\ntegically important battle spaces for China? How does China plan to use \nmilitary means in those domains? \nMilitary doctrines stand as reliable and useful sources to answer these \nquestions. Regarding China’s military doctrine, this study proposes two \ninterrelated arguments. First, as its power has increased, the evolution of \nChina’s military doctrine proves that China has adopted a more assertive and \nactive stance on issues and regions. The Chinese military’s doctrinal innova-\ntion keeps up with China’s diversifying interests and growing capacity. Sec-\nond, though China is a major power in North and Southeast Asia, the time \nis not yet ripe for it to be a global military power that can project its military \ncapability beyond the nearby seas. China’s most recent military doctrines are \ndesigned to deal with local challenges. This implies that the Chinese military \nstill does not feel that the country is likely to fight a global maritime or ter-\nritorial war in the near future.\nThis analysis examines China’s conventional military \ndoctrine and its evolution after the Cold War.\n8\nANALYSIS\ns e t a v . o r g\nINTRODUCTION\nThis study examines China’s conventional mili-\ntary doctrine and its evolution after the Cold \nWar.

Where is a military threat \nto China likely to come from? What are the stra-\ntegically important battle spaces for China? How \ndoes China plan to use military means in those \ndomains? Apart from the civilian and military \nelites’ discourses, military doctrines stand as reli-\nable and useful sources to answer these questions \nsince these elites may have incentives to manipu-\nlate international and domestic audiences and \npropagate their policies.\nThis study proposes two interrelated argu-\nments. First, as its power has increased, the evo-\nlution of China’s military doctrine proves that \nChina has adopted a more assertive and active \nstance on issues and regions. China adopted de-\nfensive military doctrines that envisaged total \nwar during the Cold War. This trend has started \nto change as China has become more powerful \nsince the end of the Cold War. The	Foundation for Political, Economic and Social Research (SETA)
china__doctrine_3	China		Chinese mili-\ntary’s doctrinal innovation keeps up with China’s \ndiversifying interests and growing capacity. In \nthe imagination of the Chinese military, the cen-\ntral theater of war has significantly moved from \nChina’s mainland (i.e. territorial domain) to \nChina’s periphery (more emphasis on the mari-\ntime domain). Since the end of the Cold War, \nChina has also abandoned its decades-old total \nwar doctrine by embracing a limited war doc-\ntrine, which is more suitable for its new political \naims. Second, though China is a major power \nin North and Southeast Asia, the time is not yet \nripe for it to be a global military power that can \nproject its military capability beyond its nearby \nseas. China’s most recent military doctrines are \ndesigned to deal with local challenges. The names \nof these doctrines reflect its concerns about local \nwars as well. This implies that China does not \nhave global strategic interests to defend through \nwar. China continues to expand and promote its \n9\ns e t a v . o r g\nCHINA’S EVOLVING MILITARY DOCTRINE AFTER THE COLD WAR\neconomic interests globally. However, the Chi-\nnese military still does not feel that China will be \ninvolved in a global maritime or territorial war, \ncontrary to what many studies suggest under the \nconcept of the “China threat.” A clear implica-\ntion of this is that when its interests in Africa, for \nexample, are at stake, it is less likely that China \nwill militarily challenge the United States. Since \nthe Chinese military has not developed a suitable \ndoctrine, such a military confrontation would be \nstrategically futile for China.\nIt is also important to note that this study \ndoes not examine the potential implications \nof a conflict between China and the United \nStates. Such a conflict would likely involve \nnuclear weapons, which are out of the scope \nof this study. The extent to which China’s con-\nventional and nuclear doctrines are coupled \nshould be discussed in a broader study, as it \nis important to	Foundation for Political, Economic and Social Research (SETA)
china__doctrine_4	China		understand under what condi-\ntions China will resort to nuclear weapons in a \npotential conflict.2\nThe study proceeds as follows: The next sec-\ntion outlines the concept of military doctrine \nand its key features. The following section in-\ntroduces some basics about the Chinese military \nand its organizational structure. The subsequent \nsections examine the evolution of China’s mili-\ntary doctrine from the Cold War onward. The \nconcluding section summarizes the analysis.\nMILITARY DOCTRINE\nA military doctrine is a sub-component of \ngrand strategy. A grand strategy is a state’s theo-\nry about how it best ensures security for itself.3 \n2. For a study on China’s nuclear doctrine see Fiona S. Cunningham and \nM. Taylor Fravel, “Assuring Assured Retaliation: China’s Nuclear Posture \nand US-China Strategic Stability”, International Security, vol. 40, no. 2, \n(2015): 7-50.\n3. Barry Posen, The Sources of Military Doctrine, (Cornell University \nPress, Ithaca: 1984), p. 13.\nMilitary doctrine is essentially about integrat-\ning military means to the political ends at the \ngrand strategic level. For a broader definition, \nOwen Cote Jr. describes military doctrine as a \n“set of tools, people, and beliefs about how to \nemploy them in battle that the major organi-\nzational elements of the military develop as a \nguide to fighting wars.”4 Barry Posen, on the \nother hand, notes that two questions are impor-\ntant about military doctrine: What means shall \nbe employed? How shall they be employed?5 A \nmilitary doctrine is a state’s response to these \nquestions. In short, a military doctrine is a \nstate’s theory about how to fight wars.\nThe formulation of a military doctrine \ncould be thought of as a two-level process. \nStates first assess the international environment \nin order to have an idea about how threats and \nopportunities are distributed in the system. For \nexample, states evaluate geographic factors, \nstate-of-the-art military technology, rising and \ndeclining powers, and the	Foundation for Political, Economic and Social Research (SETA)
china__doctrine_5	China		military capabilities \nof their neighbors. After such an assessment, \nstates turn back to see how their military or-\nganizations look like. At this point, they ana-\nlyze what is necessary and possible for their \nmilitaries.6 After this process, states formulate \ntheir military doctrines. However, this does not \nnecessarily imply that states implement this \nprocess formally and even deliberately. The for-\nmulation of military doctrines is sometimes a \nresult of an informal process. Moreover, states \nusually do not publish their military doctrines. \nThus, military exercises, available field manu-\nals, and force structure are important sources \nfor analyzing military doctrine.\n4. Owen Cote Jr., The Politics of Innovative Military Doctrine, PhD diss., \nMassachusetts Institute of Technology, 1996, p. 7.\n5. Posen, The Sources of Military Doctrine, p. 13.\n6. Ibid., p. 14.\n10\nANALYSIS\ns e t a v . o r g\nMilitary doctrine could be divided into \nsubgroups with respect to different characteris-\ntics and aspects. This study follows Posen’s cat-\negorization of military doctrine. Accordingly, \none can group military doctrine into three cat-\negories: offensive doctrines, defensive doctrines, \nand deterrent doctrines. Offensive doctrines aim \nto disarm an adversary. Defensive doctrines seek \nto deny an adversary. Deterrent doctrines aim to \npunish an adversary.7 \nStates may change their military doctrines. \nThis is called military innovation. Although there \nare various, even contradictory, definitions of in-\nnovative military doctrines, Adam Grissom argues \nthat there is a “tacit” consensus in the literature.8 \nAccordingly, this consensus has three dimensions. \nFirst, military innovations change the manner in \nwhich military organizations function in the field. \nSecond, military innovations are significant in \nscope and impact. Third, military innovations are \nexpected to increase military effectiveness.9 \nAs mentioned above, military doctrine may \naffect the stability of	Foundation for Political, Economic and Social Research (SETA)

russia_Naval_doctrine_0	Russia	Naval	THE NEW DOCTRINE OF THE RUSSIAN NAVY \n \nRosendo Fraga \nDirector of CARI’s Foreign Relations and Armed Forces Committee \n \n \nOn July 31, from Saint Petersburg (the old tsarist capital), Putin unveiled the \nnew Russian Naval Doctrine, describing the United States as the greatest threat. \nHe highlights the willingness of the Russian government to draw "red lines" in \nthe Arctic and the Black and Baltic seas. For Russia, the United States is \n“enemy number one” due to its aspiration to dominate the oceans, which \nincludes achieving the uncontested hegemony of its Navy and restricting access \nto ocean resources and communications. But NATO's infrastructure approaches \n"our borders, the increase in Western naval maneuvers and the territorial claims \nof islands and coastal areas that belong to us" are also a challenge. In particular, \nPutin said he is especially concerned about the Western tactic of "weakening \nour control of the Arctic route" that he proposes as an alternative to the Suez \nCanal. Due to the above, "we will accelerate and diversify activities in waters \nfrom the archipelagos of Novaya Zemlya, Franz Joseph Land and Svalbard (of \nNorwegian sovereignty), to the Wrangel Island". One of Russia's priorities is to \nbecome one of the leaders in exploration and exploitation of the resources of the \nArctic territory, especially the continental shelf, to which other countries, such \nas the United States, Canada and the Scandinavians, also aspire. \n \nThe Russian plan assumes the creation of naval bases in various parts of the \nworld to ensure navigation as a global power. Bases and supply points will be \nestablished from the Eastern Mediterranean to the Asia-Pacific region, the \nIndian Ocean and the Persian Gulf. It also considers to advance with the \nconstruction of aircraft carriers, a weapons system in which the United States \nhas a clear advantage (it has 13 in service). In the case of the Mediterranean, the \nmain risk is the lack of sufficient bases outside	Rosendo Fraga - Director of CARI’s Foreign Relations and Armed Forces Committee
russia_Naval_doctrine_1	Russia	Naval	Russia's borders, which can \nreceive and supply its ships and carry out repair and technical maintenance \ntasks. Russia ratified its permanent presence in the Port of Tartous, in Syria, \nwhile it will open maintenance centers in "territories of other countries in the \nregion, including Africa and the Middle East." \n \nSpecifically, it aims to increase cooperation with India, Iran, Saudi Arabia and \nIraq, with a view to having strategic alternatives to its traditional partners on the \nEuropean continent. It should be noted that Russia is the largest country in the \nworld and has approximately 40,000 kilometers of coastline. In this framework, \nthe mobilization of the Navy's resources includes civilian ships, their crews, and \nthe use of civilian maritime facilities in times of war. It should be remembered \nthat the Russian Navy in 2001 abandoned its base in Cuba and in 2004 the one it \nhad in Vietnam. But once Putin asserted himself in power, the Russian Navy \nresumed its patrols around the world from 2008, including areas under NATO's \nresponsibility. \n \nIn terms of weapons, the great novelty was the Zircon hypersonic missile, which \ngives the Russian Navy a global offensive capacity. This missile allows to \nrespond to any naval attack. They have a range of 1,000 kilometers and belong \nto a new family of weapons that Putin describes as "invincible" and that have \nbeen in development since October 2020. According to the Russian president, \nthe Admiral Gorshkov frigate will be the first ship in the fleet to receive these \nmissiles. He said that "the deployment area of this ship will be chosen in \naccordance with Russia's security interests." In Saint Petersburg, Putin presided \nover a naval parade in the Gulf of Finland (a country that has recently asked to \njoin NATO), in which 40 ships (submarines and speedboats), 42 naval aircraft \nand more than 3,500 troops participated. \n \nPutin was accompanied by Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and Navy Chief \nAdmiral Nikolai	Rosendo Fraga - Director of CARI’s Foreign Relations and Armed Forces Committee

Parades were also held in other ports due to the \ndate and the one in Kaliningrad, the Russian stronghold on the Baltic, acquired \nspecial significance. But on July 31, a Ukrainian drone fell on the Russian \nNaval Command at the Sevastopol base in Crimea, where the Black Sea \nCommand is located, forcing the suspension of events in this city. Since the \nbeginning of the invasion on February 24, the Russian fleet has played an active \nrole in missile attacks on Ukrainian territory, but has suffered significant losses, \nsuch as the most important ship in the Black Sea fleet. \n \nTo a large extent, the new doctrine is an update of that put forth by Czar Peter \nthe Great in the early 18th century, when Russia began its push westward. \nAccording to this Tsar, Russia was the power of the Five Seas: Black, Azov, \nCaspian, Baltic and Arctic. Three centuries later, the decree signed by the \nPresident in St. Petersburg on the occasion of the Navy Day asserts that "our \ninterests extend to all oceans and the Caspian Sea." It also warns that Moscow \ndoes not accept interference in its affairs in the aforementioned areas nor "in the \nSea of Okhotsk (Pacific), Azov (grabbed from Ukraine), the Kuril Islands \n(whose sovereignty Japan claims) and the straits that lead to Asia and Africa". \nThe new doctrine points out that “we have marked the borders, both economic \nand strategic. We will guarantee their defense firmly and by all means.” \n \nAt the same time, he warns that "the key is the ability of our Navy to respond \nlike lightning to all those who decide to threaten us." According to the decree, \nthe Kremlin relies on diplomatic instruments to resolve disputes, but warned \nthat it can resort to force "if necessary." Putin did not mention the Ukraine war \nin his brief speech, but said the new doctrine advocates a "complete \nstrengthening of Russia's geopolitical position in the Black and Azov seas." \n \nIn conclusion: in the new vision for the Russian Navy, announced by	Rosendo Fraga - Director of CARI’s Foreign Relations and Armed Forces Committee

At \nits most basic level, active defense involves “taking tactically offensive \naction within a basically defensive strategy.”2 The parameters within \nwhich this strategy	Book Title: Shaking the Heavens and Splitting the Earth, chapter 3 - jstor.org
china_Air_doctrine_1	China	Air	can be implemented are broad and can fall between \nthe “active” end of the spectrum and the “passive,” reactive end. The \noriginal goal of this strategy was to protect the PRC’s large cities and \nindustrial bases by using offensive operations to wear down an aggres-\nsor (in contrast to “passive defense”).3 As Chinese military capabili-\nties have improved over time, however, the active defense strategy has \nevolved from stressing the “defense” aspect to stressing the “active” \naspect in the form of a more offensively oriented strategy.4\n1 Blasko, 2006, pp. 95–96; Allen, Krumel, and Pollack, 1995, p. 23.\n2 Allen, Krumel, and Pollack, 1995, p. 24.\n3 Allen, Krumel, and Pollack, 1995, p. 25; John W.

Mao’s fears of immi-\nnent global conflict in the 1960s and his advocacy of a strategy under \nwhich the tools of war would be manufactured in factories hidden in \nChina’s interior severely impeded the development of modern military \ncapabilities.5 Mao’s perceptions also motivated violent political upheav-\nals that occurred between 1958 and 1976. These events—the Great \nLeap Forward (1958), the Sino-Soviet split (1960), and the Cultural \nRevolution (1966–1976)—adversely affected the PLAAF’s organiza-\ntional and operational development.6 After Mao’s death in 1976, the \nnet result of these	Book Title: Shaking the Heavens and Splitting the Earth, chapter 3 - jstor.org

Several mile-\nstones chart the PLA’s important doctrinal evolution. In June 1985, \nthe CMC declared that the likelihood of fighting a major, possibly \nnuclear, war was minimal and that China should instead concentrate \nits preparation on military conflicts along its periphery.7 The shift in \nfocus away from major conflict with great powers resulted in a rapid-\nreaction strategy based on the premises that China would be engaged \nonly in local wars for the foreseeable future, that the PLA would need \nto strike to end the war quickly and meet political objectives, and that \ncost would be a big factor as equipment became more expensive to use \n5 Lewis and Xue, 1999, p. 67.\n6 Allen, Krumel, and Pollack, 1995, p. xvii.\n7 Allen, Krumel, and Pollack, 1995, p. 29.\nThis content downloaded from \n103.83.145.226 on Thu, 19 Jun 2025 19:24:48 UTC \nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nThe Evolution of Chinese Air Force Doctrine    35\nand replace.8 Following the 1985 shift in strategy, Chinese military \njournals indicated five types of wars on which the PLA should focus:\n1) small-scale conflicts restricted to contested border territory, \n2) conflicts over territorial seas and islands, 3) surprise air attacks, \n4) defense against deliberately limited attacks into Chinese ter-\nritory, and 5) “punitive counterattacks” launched by China into \nenemy territory to “oppose invasion, protect sovereignty, or to \nuphold justice and dispel threats.”9 \nThe last of these is an obvious reference to China’s incursion into \nVietnam in 1979, and, as suggested by the second item, Britain’s 1982 \nconflict with Argentina over the Falkland	Book Title: Shaking the Heavens and Splitting the Earth, chapter 3 - jstor.org

The United States’ overwhelming dominance in \nthat conflict led Chinese military leaders to push for advanced mili-\ntary technologies. According to Allen, Krumel, and Pollack, China’s \nNational Defense University recommended that the PLA\n1) reduce the number of soldiers and improve the armed forces’ \nequipment, training quality, and actual combat capability; 2) give \npriority to conventional arms over nuclear weapons; 3) introduce \nhigh-technology, including advanced guidance systems, pinpoint \naccuracy bombing, weapons of mass destruction, and stealth air-\ncraft; and 4) build a rapid-response force.10\nChinese military writings began stating that the PLA must be \ncapable of winning “local wars under high-technology conditions” >催\nᡔᴃᴵӊϟሔ䚼៬ѝ@.

While the PLAAF was formally estab-\nlished on November 11, 1949, during these early years, “no consider-\nation was ever given to making the air force a service independent of \nthe army . . . because the PLA leadership did not want an autonomous \naviation force.”15 Accordingly, the PLAAF’s first commander and polit-\nical commissar were chosen directly from the army.16 The shadow cast \n11 Information Office of the State Council of the People’s Republic of China, China’s \nNational Defense in 2004, Beijing, December 27, 2004.

For example, the PLAAF’s first operational \nmission in 1949—defending Beijing and Shanghai against Nationalist \nair raids—was defensive in nature.17 Beginning in the early 1950s, one \nof the PLAAF’s primary goals was to seize air superiority >༎পࠊぎ\nᴗ@over the battlefield.18\nThe Korean War,	Book Title: Shaking the Heavens and Splitting the Earth, chapter 3 - jstor.org
china_Air_doctrine_5	China	Air	battles over Taiwan’s offshore islands, and the \nVietnam conflict shaped the evolution of China’s air force employment \nconcepts, and the tempo of air and space power growth. During the \nKorean War, the PLAAF’s original air plan was to support ground \ntroops as its primary mission, a reflection of the PLA Army’s influ-\nence on Chinese air strategy.19 The PLAAF was unable to execute this \nstrategy because of various technical limitations and had to change \nits mission to that of conducting air operations against U.S. forces. \nThis, in turn, helped the PLAAF develop basic air defense strategy and \ntactics.20\nAir operations against Nationalist forces on Taiwan’s outlying \nislands of Yijiangshan and Jinmen (the latter also known as Quemoy \nor Kinmen) in the late 1950s also helped to shape Chinese air force \nemployment concepts. The Yijiangshan Island campaign of 1954–1955 \nis the only campaign in PLA history to have involved combined air, \nground, and naval operations.21 The PLAAF’s goals were to achieve air \nsuperiority, attack Taiwanese resupply ships, conduct decoy and recon-\nnaissance missions, and provide direct air support for landing opera-\ntions.22 Lessons learned from the Yijiangshan Island campaign were to \nresonate in subsequent PLAAF strategy and employment concepts and \n17 Allen, Krumel, and Pollack, 1995, p. 101.\n18 Allen, 2002, p. 370.\n19 Zhang Xiaoming, “Air Combat for the People’s Republic: The People’s Liberation Army \nAir Force in Action, 1949–1969,” in Mark A.

Among others, the conflict \nprovides an example of how air operational principles were governed by \nrules from the very top—the CMC.28 According to Zhang Xiaoming, \nthese operational principles of the CMC stressed\n(1) using overwhelming force to achieve protection of forces and \ndestruction of enemy forces; (2) subservience of military battles to \npolitical battles by a strict adherence to CMC operational policy; \nand (3) study and application of PLAAF experiences and tactics \ndrawn from the Korean War.29\nBecause the PRC leadership was uncertain about the PLAAF’s \ncounterstrike capabilities vis-à-vis Taiwan, PLAAF doctrine remained \ndefensive.

The Sino-\nSoviet split’s primary effect on the PLAAF was to significantly slow \nmodernization efforts, as China was highly dependent on Soviet tech-\nnology transfers for equipping the PLAAF.32 And, due to the fact that \nan air force is, by its very nature, a more technically oriented service \nthan the army, the PLAAF suffered greatly during the Cultural Revo-\nlution, which eschewed anything having to do with intellectualism and \nexpertise. Furthermore, the PLAAF’s association with Defense Minis-\nter Lin Biao’s failed coup attempt against Mao in 1971 resulted in it \nbeing marginalized until after Mao’s death and the rehabilitation of \nDeng Xiaoping in 1978.33 Partly as a consequence, PLAAF involve-\nment during China’s war with Vietnam in 1979 was limited. As in the \ncase of the Jinmen conflict, China’s air involvement during the conflict \nwas constrained both by political factors—not wanting to involve the \nUnited States in the former case and the Soviet Union in the latter—\nand by the limited capabilities of the PLAAF.\nDeng ushered in a new era of economic and military reform, \nwhich set all military services on a path to modernization and reform.

First, by \nattaching special political weight to the PLAAF, Deng not only wanted \nto alleviate the decrepit state of Chinese airpower; he also wanted to \nkeep tight control over the PLAAF so as to prevent it from becoming \nthe politically dangerous service it had been under Lin Biao during the \nCultural Revolution.36 Second, the army-centric mentality ingrained \nduring the Mao era attenuated efforts to implement near-term improve-\nments in the PLAAF.37 For example, when the PLA began reorganiz-\ning ground forces into group armies in the early 1980s, the PLAAF was \ngiven guidance that its role was to support the needs of ground forces \nand that a victory was a ground force victory.38 \nThe Gulf War of 1991 spurred renewed debate within the PLAAF \nand Chinese military establishment about how to modernize and \ndevelop Chinese airpower. The U.S. show of force in the Taiwan Strait \ncrisis of 1996, in which the United States deployed two aircraft-carrier \nbattle groups near Taiwan in response to Chinese military intimida-\ntion of Taiwan, further motivated doctrinal reform and technological \nmodernization efforts in the PLAAF. The PLAAF’s desire for a strategy \nof “quick reaction,”	Book Title: Shaking the Heavens and Splitting the Earth, chapter 3 - jstor.org

For example, one challenge to execu-\ntion of the aforementioned rapid-reaction strategy was the lack of a \n40 Lewis and Xue, 1999, p. 80.\n41 Lewis and Xue, 1999, p. 80.\n42 Lewis and Xue, 1999, p. 80.\n43 Allen, Krumel, and Pollack, 1995, p. 105.\n44 Allen, Krumel, and Pollack, 1995, p. 109.\n45 Allen, Krumel, and Pollack, 1995, p. 111.

Overlapping rings means \norganizing each weapon system into left, middle or right fire-\npower rings facing the most likely avenue of approach.59\nIn 1993, after the Gulf War, 60 airpower specialists formed an \nairpower theory, strategy, and development study group to investi-\ngate independent air campaigns.60 According to one study, by 1997, \nthe Chinese air force had “claimed precedence over the other service \nbranches, and the People’s War as a unifying dogma had given way to \nservice-specific strategies.”61 \nAccording to another study, as of the late 1990s, the primary \nPLAAF missions were air coercion, air offensives, air blockades, and \nsupport for ground force operations.62 Coercion could come in the \n57 Allen, Krumel, and Pollack, 1995, p. 118.\n58 Allen, Krumel, and Pollack, 1995, p. 115.\n59 Allen, Krumel, and Pollack, 1995, pp. 115–116.\n60 Stokes, 2005, p. 246.\n61 Lewis and Xue, 1999, pp. 89–90.\n62 Stokes, 2005, p. 247. The Chinese term for coercion, weishe >࿕ᜥ@, is translated by \nmany analysts, including Stokes, 2005, as deterrence. As Stokes himself argues, however, \nweishe actually encompasses both deterrence, as it is normally understood, and compellence—\nforcing an adversary to do something it would not otherwise wish to do. The more accurate \ntranslation of weishe, therefore, is coercion, which, in Western strategic writings, also includes \nboth deterrence and compellence. Stokes, 2005, p. 247, also uses the term air strikes rather \nthan air offensives.

It could also come in the	Book Title: Shaking the Heavens and Splitting the Earth, chapter 3 - jstor.org

Air offensives, by contrast, would \nentail large-scale strikes with the goal of rapidly gaining air superiority, \nreducing an adversary’s capacity for military operations, and establish-\ning the conditions necessary for victory. An air blockade would entail \nattacks on airfields and seaports as well as air, land, and sea transpor-\ntation routes with the goal of cutting an enemy off from contact with \nthe outside world. Support for ground force operations would include \nattacks on logistics facilities, hardened coastal defenses (in the case of \nan amphibious operation), reinforcements, and key choke points, such \nas bridges. It would also include battlefield close air support, strategic \nand theater airlift, airborne operations against command headquarters, \nand the deployment of ground-based air defenses to protect ground \nforces and key facilities.63\nAccording to Stokes, as of the late 1990s, PLAAF operational \nprinciples included “surprise and first strikes,” “concentration of best \nassets,” “offensive action as a component of air defense,” and “close \ncoordination.” Surprise and first strikes refers to the goal of crippling \nan opponent and gaining the initiative early in a conflict through sur-\nprise and large-scale attacks on key targets, such as the enemy’s air \ncommand-and-control structure, key air bases, and SAM sites. Con-\ncentration of best assets supports this principle and refers to using the \nPLAAF’s best assets in the initial strikes and to dedicating the majority \nof them to targets that will have the most influence on a campaign. \nOffensive action as a component of air defense refers to using offensive \ncounter–air attacks as an integral aspect of air defense by attacking \nthose enemy assets that pose the greatest threat. Close coordination refers \nto coordinating the air assets of all services (Army, PLAN, PLAAF, \nto which he is referring, kongzhong jingong >ぎЁ䖯ᬏ@, as air offensives.

What Western analysts do know is that the guidance \nshows that the PLAAF had deepened its understanding of the opera-\ntional level of war. The PLAAF was also now tasked with preparing \nfor three types of air force campaigns: air offensive, air defense, and air \nblockade.66\nUntil 2004, the PLAAF lacked its own, service-specific strategy, \nand the actual ability of the PLAAF to integrate its campaign and oper-\national principles with the Second Artillery, PLA Army, and PLAN was \nquestionable. One study states that, until that time, the Chinese air force \nrelied “almost solely on the PLA Army’s ‘Active Defense’ operational \ncomponent as its strategic-level doctrinal guidance.”67 The approval of \nthe PLAAF’s active defense strategy as a component of the National \nMilitary Strategic Guidelines for air operations in 2004, however, indi-\ncated an important shift in the PLAAF’s status.68 The PLAAF’s stra-\ntegic component of the National Military Strategic Guidelines is now \nidentified as “‘Integrated Air and Space, Simultaneous Offensive and \n64 Stokes, 2005, pp. 250–254.\n65 Allen, 2005b, p. 3.\n66 Allen, 2005b,	Book Title: Shaking the Heavens and Splitting the Earth, chapter 3 - jstor.org

russia_Air_doctrine_0	Russia	Air	The fog of war continues to hangover Ukraine even after \neighty days, especially with facts difficult to discern amongst \nthe information war running in parallel, biased reportage, and \ncontradictory  narratives  based  on  the  wide  swath  of \ninternational  political  agendas.  In  this  war  of  shifting \nobjectives  and  seemingly  endless  attrition,  showcased  in \ndestruction, death and human misery, it is extremely difficult \nto discern cogent military lessons with a significant degree of \ncertainty. As much analysis continues on the larger Russian \nstrategic goals, miscalculations, shifting military aims, and the \nconduct of warfare, this follow-up piece retains its focus on \nthe air operations. It hopes to address some of the larger \nstructural  and  doctrinal  aspects  of  the  Russian  Aerospace \nForce (VKS) which have affected the war aims and put to \nquestion  the  efficacy  of  the  Russian  military  strategy.  The \nfocus here is to fit some of the larger visible pieces, amongst \nthe many missing ones on the broad mosaic of air power \nemployment, as they slowly emerge. The less than expected \ndemonstrated performance of the Russian Army, the unclear \noperational employment concepts of the Air Force and the \nevident dissonance in integration between the two, have led \nsome analysts to lay the blame on the VKS for its inability to \n‘support’ ground operations, and even question the very need \nof an independent Air Force. This is a deeply concerning trend \nof  thought  which  underscores  the  absence  of  a  deeper \nunderstanding of air power in some quarters.\nThe VKS is not ‘missing in action’ as many thought after \nthe sudden decline in tempo from the initial surge operations \nearly in the war. It has actually been active throughout, albeit \nwith varying degrees of roles and intensity of employment, \nwith tactical adjustments in their concepts of operations in \nkeeping  with  shifting  war  aims  and  losses.  It  is  currently \nplaying a major	Air Marshal Diptendu Choudhury (Retd, India) - vifiinida.org

It  is  attacking  the  Ukrainian \nmilitary,  command  and  control  centres,  fuel  and  weapon \nstorages, power plants, waterworks, and a variety of targets \nin  the  combat  zone.  Importantly,  the  extensive  and  ever-\nexpanding  Allied  support  in  the  form  of  military  materiel \nlogistics supply chains via road and rail networks, which are \nsustaining the Ukrainian forces, has been added to the target \nlist.  But  there  is  no  denying  the  fact  that  the  VKS  has \nunderperformed,  and –‘Analysts  have  ascribed  a  variety  of \nreasons  which  range  from  inadequacy  of  precision  guided \nmunitions’ inventory, inability to manage the contested airspace \nbetween Russian Air Force and the SAM (Surface to Air Missile) \nsystems  of  the  Russian  Army,  low  training  standards  of  the \nRussian pilots due to inadequate flying hours, their inability to \nundertake large scale offensive missions, poor Army-Air Force \ncoordination, to the reluctance on part of the VKS leadership to \nengage  in  operations  which  would  lay  bare  their  capability \ngaps.’[1]While these reasons in part or combined have played a \npart  in  the  underperformance,  despite  its  losses  it  has \ncontinued  to  carry  out  extensive  operations,  causing \nconsiderable damage to the Ukrainian forces, both in air and \non  surface.  Though  it  is  premature  to  draw  definitive \nconclusions on its operational performance, there are some \ndeeper issues in the mighty Russian military machine which \nhave impacted the prosecution of military operations, and \ntheir war aims.\nThe fundamental orientation and posturing of the Russian \nmilitary over the years, still remains centred on defending its \nheartland and vital industries and cities, using layered and \nintegrated  air  defence.

This was demonstrated in Georgia (2008), Crimea \n(2014) and especially Syria (2015), but in the absence of any \nviable  air  opposition,  the  offensive  use  of  air  power  was \nlimited  in  scale.  While  Russia  has  observed  air  power \nemployment in Western interventions closely over the last \ntwo decades, it is the structural and doctrinal aspects of the \nVKS and its place in the Russian military that remains Army \ncentric. In the Soviet days, the PVO Strany was the dominant \nmilitary air element which owned all AD forces including its \nown aircraft. It was the favoured force as it was central to \nwinning ground campaigns, in comparison to the Russian Air \nForce (VVS) whose role was limited to providing tactical fire \npower from the air. [2] In 1988 the air assets of the PVO Strany \nwere merged with the VVS and its AD missile element formed \nthe Russian Air Defence Force (VKO). In 2011, the VKO became \nthe Russian Aerospace Defence Force (VVKO) to merge air and \nspace defence. In 2015, Russia merged the VVS and the VVKO \nto form what is now known as the Russian Aerospace Force. \nThe Russian Defence Minister Army General Sergey Shoigu \nhad  then  said  that  the  VKS  was  created  because “their \nformation is dictated by the shift in the centre of gravity of armed  \nstruggle into the aerospace sphere.”  [3]\nThe  VKS  is  organised,  equipped  and  trained  to  repel \nenemy threats, and essentially operates the high-altitude and \nlong-distance  AD  systems  –  the  S-300s  and  S-400s.This \nenables a very strong access denial into Russian airspace. The \nRussian  Army  on  the  other  hand  owns  the  battlefield  AD \nsystems which are limited to defending against air attacks at \nthe  low  and  medium  altitudes.  In  a  2019  speech  at  the \nRussian Academy of Military Sciences, the Russian chief of \nGeneral Staff, Valery Gerasimov, described	Air Marshal Diptendu Choudhury (Retd, India) - vifiinida.org
russia_Air_doctrine_3	Russia	Air	Russia’s military \nstrategy  as  one  of  ‘active  defence.’ [4] This  leads  to  the \nstructural  challenge  for  its  military,  essentially  oriented  to \ndefend the nation against a massive multi-domain threat to \nits  heartland,  in  carrying  out  large  scale  orchestrated \noffensive operations with overwhelming force, which involves \nextensive  participation  of  the  VKS.  All  of  Russia’s  recent \nmilitary operations have been on a much smaller scale, with \nrelatively very little involvement of its aerospace force. The \nlessons learnt in the Georgian campaign in 2008, initiated its \nmilitary  reform  and  modernisation  efforts  which  are  still \nunderway.\nIts strategic exercises - Zapad, Vostok, Tsentsr and Kavkaz \nwere introduced as capstone events of its annual training \ncycle.[5] These  large-scale  exercises  meant  to  showcase  its \noperational art, military strategy and capability in two front \noperations,  nuclear  might,  etc.,  and  serves  as  strategic \ncommunication.  Zapad  2021  exercised  its  ‘active  defence’ \nstrategy to counter a massed NATO aerospace attack. The VKS \nand surface missile units conducted counter-strikes with long \nrange precision guided weapons against the enemy force, \ncommand and control, and key supporting infrastructure, to \nsupport large air assault operations employing helicopters in \ntransport and attack roles, concentrating artillery and rocket \nfire against enemy forces to cause attrition. Russian units \nthen switch to a counteroffensive, with large combined arms \nassault.[6] Typically,  the  VKS  only  supported  the  surface \noperations rather than first create conditions offensively to \ncounter the enemy air, as they have in the Ukraine invasion.\nThe next issue is that, very much like the erstwhile Soviet \ndays  even  today  in  Russia,  aircraft  are  extensions  of  the \nground  force.  Combat  aircraft  are  essentially  considered \nairborne  artillery:  inflexible  vehicles  for  the  delivery  of	Air Marshal Diptendu Choudhury (Retd, India) - vifiinida.org
russia_Air_doctrine_4	Russia	Air	massive firepower. Therefore, the Russian military doctrine \ndoesn’t require the VKS to control large swathes of airspace in \norder  to  pursue  its  operations  towards  surface  campaign \ngoals. Aside from long-range high-altitude AD, the VKS owns \nthe long-range bombers for nuclear and conventional strikes \n(long range aviation), and the military transport fleet. It also \nhas the VVS (frontline aviation or tactical aviation), which till \nonly recently was limited to air operations over the tactical \nbattle areas. The VVS with its modern four plus generation \nand fifth generation fighters, with a weapon mix of large \nnumber of older generation and some advanced ones, has a \ndefensive  AD  role  against  aerial  threats  and  an  offensive \nstrick role restricted to the surface campaign. Long range air \nlaunched precision and stand-off strikes have only recently \nbeen included in its offensive capability. These enable it to \nengage  targets  deeper  inside  enemy  territory,  which  its \nbombers  cannot  take  on  in  a  dense  AD  environment. \nHelicopters are an important constituent of the military and \nare considered as ground weapons (or ‘tanks in the air’) by the \nRussian General Staff in their operational planning. Since the \nreform,  these  formations  are  known  as  ‘army  aviation \nbrigades’,[7] and  despite  their  high  vulnerability  to  SAMs, \nremain  ‘major  force  multipliers  during  Russian  joint \noperations’.[8] It  is  commanded  by  Army  General  Sergei \nSurovikin,  who  unlike  his  predecessor  is  from  the  ground \nforces.\nThe Russian military strategy, unlike the American and \nmost  modern  militaries,  does  not  allow  its  Air  Force  the \nfreedom to pursue its own air campaign. Hence its doctrine \ndoes not require the VVS to offensively achieve control over \nthe adversarial airspace. Consequently, it is not geared to \ncarry  out  large  scale  offensive  air  operations,  where  all \nelements  of  offensive  counter  air  fighters,	Air Marshal Diptendu Choudhury (Retd, India) - vifiinida.org
russia_Air_doctrine_5	Russia	Air	suppression  of \nenemy  AD  (SEAD)  aircraft,  strike  aircraft,  ISR  and  EW \nelements, AD escorts fighters, combine with AWACS and aerial \nrefuellers come together to offensively seize control of the air \nand facilitate the surface campaign. The initial Russian air and \nmissile  strikes  that  targeted  over  a  dozen  airfields,  the \nUkrainian Air Force (PSU) and its AD systems were extensive. \nIt severely impacted the PSU’s operational capability and its \nlong and medium range AD cover.[9] However, after the initial \nsuccess, Russia failed to follow to put the PSU and its AD out \nof  action.  Total  destruction  is  hard  to  achieve,  unless  the \nmassive and sustained air offensives of the likes of Gulf War \nare  carried  out,  and  where  there  was  practically  no  air \nopposition.  Against  an  adversary  with  a  much  smaller  Air \nForce  (AF),  the  possibility  of  achieving  air  supremacy  (no \ninterference  from  enemy  air)  or  air  superiority  (minimal \ninterference  from  enemy  air)  is  high.  Provided,  there  is \nconcerted effort by the side on the offensive to do so, and its \nAF is given a free hand to execute its air operations against \nthe  adversarial  AF.  Thus,  in  their  effort  to  carry  out  swift \noffensive  operations,  employing  precepts  of  mass  and \nmanoeuvre,  without  having  achieved  a  viable  degree  of \ncontrol of airspace, has led to greater Russian Army and AF \nlosses. According to David Deptula –“Russia has never fully \nappreciated  the  use  of  airpower  beyond  support  to  ground \nforces. As a result, Russia, in all its wars, has never conceived of \nor run a strategic air campaign.”[10]\nThere  have  been  numerous  assessments  of  the \noperational performance of AD and AF on both sides, and \nalmost all have tended to look at them either independently \nor at best as the combat outcomes and effects of being pitted \nagainst each other. This approach, while it serves to suit the \nnarrative of some and the	Air Marshal Diptendu Choudhury (Retd, India) - vifiinida.org
russia_Air_doctrine_6	Russia	Air	vested interests of the weapon \nindustries,  may  lead  to  incorrect  and  incomplete  military \nlessons.  Since  even  media  anchors  have  become  ‘military \nexperts’ eager to pronounce ‘breaking news’ analyses, there is \na real danger of looking at the serious and complex business \nof offensive air and AD operations simplistically. Offensive \nemployment of air power is the raison d’être of air forces, and \nair defence is inherently integral to it. They are the con-joined \ntwins of air power as they are not only inter-dependent; they \ncannot do without each other. The challenge arises when AD \noperations are looked at only from a defensive perspective \nagainst  the  adversary’s  offensive  air  operations,  without \nconsidering the necessity to counter the adversary’s AD to \nprosecute one’s own offensive air operations. Offensive air \npower remains a vital element of a nation’s military power, not \njust towords effectively ‘supporting’ the surface campaign, but \nequally importantly, to take the war deep into the adversarial \nspaces, towards achieving the larger war aim. And therefore, \nfor offensive air power to succeed in both the roles, it has to \ndefeat the adversarial AF. Simply put, AD is a vital element in \nboth offensive and defensive employment of air power, and \ncannot be seen in isolation.\nThe  large  numbers  of  Russian  helicopter  and  fighter \nlosses at low levels have been due to the dated and rigid \ndoctrinal  approach  of  air  power  employment,  which  is  a \nsubset of the surface dominant military strategy. Having lost \n333 helicopters to the Stinger shoulder fired SAM and Anti-\nAircraft guns in Afghanistan one would have thought there \nwould have been a doctrinal revisit.[11] Interestingly, in the air \noperations  in  2015  where  the  Russian  AF  supported  Syria \nagainst the ISIS, it lost only one fighter to Man Portable AD \nSystem (MANPADS) out its total of 19 aircraft losses, in 34,000 \nsorties over almost two and half years.[12] This	Air Marshal Diptendu Choudhury (Retd, India) - vifiinida.org
russia_Air_doctrine_7	Russia	Air	was because \nthe VVS, which was deployed independently and was not a \npart of a combined Russian military campaign, conducted its \noperations  from  medium  altitudes  outside  the  MANPADs \nthreat envelope.[13] However, this experience does not appear \nto have translated to any doctrinal changes as was evident in \nits  early  air  operations  in  Ukraine,  where  it  followed  the \nscripted operational concepts of the Russian military. The VVS \nevidently does not have the freedom to evolve and pursue its \nown  air  doctrine  and  concept  of  operations,  when  it  is \nemployed  as  a  part  of  a  larger  military  whole. \nNotwithstanding doctrinal rigidities, substantial aircraft losses \nwhich includes high end and legacy assets, has forced the VVS \nto shift its fighter operations to the medium altitudes very \nquickly  over  Ukraine.  Helicopter  offensive  operations  over \ncontested airspaces by day have significantly reduced, and \nshifted  into  the  night  where  they  cannot  be  targeted  by \nelectro-optical/infrared MANPADS.\nArguably,  the  shortcomings  of  the  Russian  AF \nemployment were inevitable because of two reasons. First, \nthe  VVS  still  essentially  remains  a  ‘ground  support’  force, \nwhere  its  focus  was  essentially  centred  on  providing  the \nsurface campaign with aerial fire power, and not ensuring that \nthe  PSU could  not  interfere  with  their  surface  operations. \nThere  have  been  attempts  at  change  from  the  erstwhile \nSoviet AF concepts towards those of modern Air Forces, where \nthe military understanding of air power and independence of \nthe  air  force  to  prosecute  air  operations  is  much  more \nsophisticated,  and  produces  greater  integrated  military \noutcomes.  But  it  in  the  absence  of  any  participation  in \ninternational air exercises with modern air forces, it appears \nthat the transformation has been limited to organisational \nrestructuring and superficial changes. There have been no	Air Marshal Diptendu Choudhury (Retd, India) - vifiinida.org
russia_Air_doctrine_8	Russia	Air	independent  doctrinal  changes  in  its  overarching  VKS  of \nwhich VVS is a part of, as the Russian Army dominant military \ncontinues to adhere to its legacy approach to air power of the \nSoviet era. The second reason is the discernible disconnect in \nthe AD structuring and its employment. The VKS AD centred \non  defending  the  heartland  is  an  Integrated  Air  Defence \nSystem (IADS), which enables what the West calls Anti-Access \nArea-Denial (A2AD). Bronk explains – ‘For Russia, the IADS is a \nfundamentally static construct composed of mobile elements. It is \ndesigned to defend Russian airspace and to give the Kremlin an \nability to threaten aircraft with long-range missiles some distance \ninside neighbouring countries’ airspace and in the Baltic from \nbehind a multi-layered and sophisticated network of medium- \nand short-range SAMs. It is also a critical part of the Russian  \nGround Forces’ plans to be ready to fight or coerce NATO forces in  \nEastern Europe, by forcing NATO’s air forces to spend the first  \ncritical weeks of any conflict engaged in a protracted, costly and \npolitically high-risk SEAD/DEAD campaign rather than attacking \nground forces and strategic objectives inside Russia.’[14]Given the \nUkrainian Air Force's incapability to operate over the Russian \nairspace, the VVS has failed to exploite its own IADS cover, \nwhich extends well into the Ukrainian airspace offensivly.\nAgainst an adversary with a small AF which could interfere \nwith its surface campaign, control of the skies should have \nbeen a priority for the Russian military. Its initial stand-off \nstrikes against airfields and AD systems in Ukraine, gave the \nimpression that it was part of an orchestrated counter air and \nSEAD campaign. While it caused serious attrition to Ukraine’s \nAD radars and SAM systems initially, it did not follow through \nby going after its AF. The PSU fighters which were flying blind \nwithout  ground  control  radars  guiding  it  and  without  the \nprotective	Air Marshal Diptendu Choudhury (Retd, India) - vifiinida.org
russia_Air_doctrine_9	Russia	Air	cover of its long-range SAMs, were vulnerable to \nhigh end Russian fighters armed with Beyond Visual Range \n(BVR) air-air missiles, whose ranges were more than Ukrainian \nBVRs. Not having offensively destroyed the PSU’s air assets, \nenabled it to survive and fight on. Russian IADS, whose lethal \nranges extend well inside Ukrainian territory, inhibits the PSU \nfrom carrying out air operations at high and medium altitudes \nfreely  over  the  battle-spaces.  Combined  with  the  Russian \nArmy  which  owns  a  variety  of  AD  systems  to  protect  the \nairspace over the battle zones from medium to low altitude \nthreats, also denied the PSU the opportunity to interdict the \nadvancing Russian forces. This was evident when the long \nRussian  armour  columns  and  logistic  convoys  which  were \nforced to use roads due to the ‘Rasputitsa season’,[15] were \nnot engaged by the PSU. So why did the VVS fighters fail to \nleverage  this  to  their  advantage  as  well?  For  the  VVS  to \nprovide  close  support  inside  its  Army  AD’s  lethal  missile \nengagement  zone,  it  would  need  excellent  airspace \nmanagement which de-conflicts friend from foe to prevent \nfratricide. While it is not clear what kind of interface and \nintegration exits between the VKS and the Russian Army for \nairspace  management,  it  is  evident  that  there  have  been \nserious  gaps  here  as  AD  operations  have  remained \nindependent  from  offensive  air  operations.  Despite  losing \nmost of its high and medium level AD assets, Ukraine with \nextensive ISR and tactical assistance from its Allies, has been \neffective in employing its surviving mobile AD systems and \nlarge supplies of Western MANPADs. Tactical inflexibility of \ncommander’s intent and campaign aims, forces the VVS to fly \nsingly or in pairs into and out of hostile airspaces without any \ntactical routing, decoying or deception to enhance mission \nsurvival against the enemy AD.\nThe depth  of  the  military  objective  directly	Air Marshal Diptendu Choudhury (Retd, India) - vifiinida.org
russia_Air_doctrine_10	Russia	Air	affects  the \ntime-space-volume  of  air  operations.  Deeper  the  surface \ncampaign objective, means greater is the application of air \npower that will be necessary. With Kiev as the initial objective, \nwhere the surface forces would have taken greater time to \nreach, compounded by the mobility challenges of the season, \nalso  meant  more  space  on  ground  and  larger  volume  of \nairspace  would  have  to  be  covered.  Clearly  the  Russian \nmilitary strategy, which did not have a counter air campaign \ncoordinated with SEAD and integrated AD in its play book, \nwas unable to achieve the swift outcomes it expected. The \ndisconnect  between  the  long  range  and  stand-off  missile \nattacks, the initial air operations and the ground campaign \nappears to indicate challenges in the organisational structure, \nevident  in  the  lack  of  coordination  amongst  branches, \nindicating  issues  with  command  and  control,  both  at  the \ntactical and the operational levels. Russian commanders seem \nto have been unprepared for many aspects of the invasion, \nincluding coordination between branches and between units.\n[16] Absence of joint planning, training and execution have \nbeen evident through the campaign, and even necessitated a \nleadership change midway, with General Alexander Dvornikov \ntaking charge. What could be the problem?\nWay back in 2010, Russian Military Districts (MD) were \nreorganised  into  Operational  Strategic  Commands  (OSKs), \nwhere its frontal and army aviation were transferred from the \nAir Forces to be directly subordinate to Russia’s four new \nOSKs. According to the then Air Force CINC, General-Colonel \nAleksandr Zelin – “The Air Forces will remain a service of the \nArmed  Forces,  its  Main  Command  (Glavkomat)  will  continue \nfunctioning,  the  transfer  of  four  Air  Forces  and  Air  Defense \ncommands to the commanders of the new military districts - \nWestern,  Southern,  Central  and  Eastern.”  This  was  –“just  to \noptimize command	Air Marshal Diptendu Choudhury (Retd, India) - vifiinida.org
russia_Air_doctrine_11	Russia	Air	and control and concentrate the main forces \nand means in the troops (OSK).” The new system of command \nand control was ostensibly created due to ‘the realities of the \ncurrent  time  and  changing  international  situation,  so  the \nstate  can  independently  confront  possible  threats  to  its \nsecurity and the security of its allies, and achieve strategic \ngoals’.[17] Defense  commentator  Igor  Korotchenko  said  the \nmove to four MDs / OSKs has diminished the service CINC’s \ninfluence: “The role and place of the main commands of the \nservices of the Armed Forces has been reduced accordingly. \nPractically all aviation, except strategic, will be subordinate to \nthe  OSK  commander.”[18] It  seems  clear  that  the  Russian \nmilitary does not understand airpower, let alone leverage it to \nits  advantage.  Western  experts  echo  this  view. ‘Instead  of \nworking  to  control  the  skies,  Russia’s  air  force  has  mostly \nprovided air  support  to  ground  troops  or  bombed  Ukrainian \ncities.  In  this  it  has  followed  the  traditional  tactics  of  a  \ncontinental power that privileges land forces. Focusing on ground \ntroops can work if you have almost endless numbers of soldiers  \nand are prepared to lose them. But so wedded is Russia to its \nhistory of successes on the ground that it fails to understand the \nimportance of airpower.’[19]\nThough the focus has been on the larger pieces of the \nunderperformance  of  the  Russian  air  power,  two  aspects \nwhich  have  rightfully  earned  their  place  in  contemporary \nwarfare  –  MANPADS  and  drones,  need  a  mention  here. \nWithout  taking  away  anything  from  the  demonstrated \nlethality of these two weapon systems, the hype of their role \nbeing a ‘game changer’ in warfare, where the future manned \ncombat aircraft are being written off, is certainly overstated. \nIn the brutal business of warfare, the ‘game’ of war remains \nthe  same,  nothing  ‘changes.’  The  ways  to  ‘kill’  proliferate. \nThere	Air Marshal Diptendu Choudhury (Retd, India) - vifiinida.org
russia_Air_doctrine_12	Russia	Air	are many aspects of the air operations conducted by \nboth sides from which serious lessons can be drawn. But \nthose are deeper operational, tactical and technical aspects \nand including use of drones and MANPADS amongst many \nother  vital  aspects  like  EW,  secure  and  encrypted \ncommunications, advanced weaponry, etc. But for now, one \ncannot overlook from wider standpoint that despite the losses \nand inefficient use of air power, the VKS has contributed much \nto the war despite the shifting war aims. From an Indian \ncontext  the  two  larger  issues  which  need  greater \ndeliberations are the fact that the Russian Military evidently \ndoes  not  seem  to  understand  air  power  fully,  and  that \nsubordinating it in their reorganised OSK twelve years ago, \nhas had serious consequences in the national war objectives. \nThe other is, AD operations and offensive operations are the \ninseparable  twins  of  modern  air  warfare,  and  their  close \nsynergy will remain a prerequisite for combat operations of \nthe future, and therefore must form an integral part of a \nnation’s military strategy.

The provisions of the Military Doctrine are specified in the addresses of the President of the \nRussian Federation to the Federal Assembly of the Russian Federation and may be adjusted within \nthe framework of strategic planning in the military sphere (military planning). \n7. Implementation of the Military Doctrine shall be achieved through the centralization of state \ngovernance in the field of defense and security and shall be carried out in accordance with federal \nlegislation and statutory legal acts of the President of the Russian Federation, the Government of the \nRussian Federation, and federal executive authorities. \n8. The following basic terms are used in the Military Doctrine: \na) military security of the Russian Federation (hereinafter military security) is the state of safety of \nvital interests of the individual, the society, and the State from external and internal military threats \nrelated to the use or a threat of the use of military force that is characterized by the absence of a \nmilitary threat or by the ability to counter such a threat; \nb) military risk is a situation in the inter-state or intra-state relations characterized by the totality of \nfactors which can lead to a military threat under certain conditions; \nc) military threat is a situation in the inter-state or intra-state relations characterized by a real \npossibility of an outbreak of a military conflict between opposing sides and by a high degree of \nreadiness of a given state (group of states) or separatist (terrorist) organizations to resort to military \nforce (armed violence); \nd) military conflict is a form of resolving inter-state or intra-state contradictions with the use of \nmilitary force (the term encompasses all types of armed confrontation, including large-scale, \nregional and local wars and armed conflicts); \ne) armed conflict is an armed clash of a limited	Russian Military and Security Research group (RMSRG) - https://rmsrg.org/

MILITARY RISKS AND MILITARY THREATS \nENCOUNTERED BY THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION \n \n9. World development at the present stage is characterized by the strengthening of global \ncompetition, tensions in various areas of inter-state and interregional interaction, rivalry of \nproclaimed values and models of development, instability of the processes of economic and \npolitical development at the global and regional levels against a background of general \ncomplication of international relations. There is a stage-by-stage redistribution of influence in \nfavour of new centres of economic growth and political attraction. \n10. Many regional conflicts remain unresolved. There is a continuing tendency towards their \nresolution with the use of force, including in regions bordering the Russian Federation. The existing \ninternational security architecture (system) does not ensure equal security for all states. \n11. There is a tendency towards shifting the military risks and military threats to the information \nspace and the internal sphere of the Russian Federation. At the same time, despite the fact that \nunleashing of a large-scale war against the Russian Federation becomes less probable, in a number \nof areas the military risks encountered by the Russian Federation are increasing. \n12. The main external military risks are: \na) build-up of the power potential of the North	Russian Military and Security Research group (RMSRG) - https://rmsrg.org/

israel_doctrine_2	Israel		doctrine \nstands as a guiding beacon that guides governments and countries to victory. It’s a tool summarizes \nmany centuries of conflict to provide governments and states with a comprehensive framework for \ndecision-making, planning, and implementation. Despite the ambiguity surrounding military \ndoctrine concept , according to Jackson military doctrine can simply be defined as a concrete \npicture of the military institutional belief system regarding how the army understood, prepared and \nmanaging  the military activities. (Jackson, 2017) While Spencer defines military doctrine as a \nmilitary term that describes states  fundamental principles upon which forces and military elements \nactions are directed in support of national goals. These principles are considered as army's views \nreflection that stemming and learned from previous experiences and previous wars. In fact, it is a \nset of ideas that represents an integrated reference frame including the intellectual tools used by \narmy leaders to solve military problems. Military doctrine is also considered to have a cognitive \nnature that allows it to acquire, distribute and evaluate knowledge beside the flexibility and ability \nto change and modify. Moreover it is an important tool that provides a formal representation of \ntactical, strategic and operational realities. (Spencer, WHAT IS ARMY DOCTRINE?, 2017)  \nIt is worth to mention that doctrine takes two different forms: classical unwritten doctrine and \ncontemporary written doctrine; Firstly, the unwritten classic doctrine could takes many forms such \nas   educational curricula, power structure development, acquisition preferences or it may also be \ngenes passed down through the tongues. (Eldadi, 2019) On the other hand, the contemporary \nwritten doctrine takes forms of written booklets and folders, However the contemporary written \ndoctrine considered the most effective and is most commonly used by western military, due to its \nclarity and ease of understanding	ResearchGate
israel_doctrine_3	Israel		compared to the unwritten classical doctrine, in addition to \ncontaining a better explanation of advanced international relations, militias, the relations between \nstates and their populations. it also includes scientific and intellectual trends in a broader way. \n(Jackson, 2017) \nWith regard to the main role military doctrine, essentially the main function  of  military doctrine \nis to protect the state sovereignty, interests and state’s national security from any external threat \nand achieve success in conflicts and wars. To attain those security objectives, military doctrine \nprimarily contributes to the advancement of military strategy though out offering expertise, \neducational resources, vocational training and military instruction. Moreover, military doctrine \ninvolves analyzing operational challenges and providing guidance for tactical and operational \nendeavors. Nevertheless there are many factors may influence military doctrine such as historical \nanalysis and military concepts, policies and strategic environments, technology, lessons learned \nfrom previous wars and battles, political circumstances, national culture, tactical and operational \nrequirements, in addition to collective and individual experiences. The state’s internal and foreign \npolicy contributes fundamentally to determine the doctrine’s directions and structure, if the \n4 \n \ndoctrine is affected by any of the previous factors, this may require a change or development of \nthe doctrine. (Jackson, 2017) \nThe purpose of this paper is to is to define the objectives and principles of Israeli military doctrine. \nWhy does it exist? To what extent does the doctrine strategy adapt to regional threats? How flexible \nis the doctrine to face changes in strategic environments over time?  The extent of the strategic \nlevel's significance and how it affects the other levels of the doctrine are also covered in this paper. \nLight has been highlighted in The study looks at how much military strategy has	ResearchGate
israel_doctrine_4	Israel		changed in the \nland, air, and sea forces, in addition defense army's organizational structure, and the cyberspace \ndomain to keep up with the opponents' and wars' transition from powerful nations fighting \ntraditional conflicts to not effective groups like Hamas and Hezboallah which can differ depending \non various unconventional wars. \nIsraeli military doctrine in the light of changing strategic environments:  \n \nThe Classical Doctrine  \n \nIn 1950 the prime minister David Ben-Gurin developed the fundamentals of Israeli military \ndoctrine which can be defined as a classic military doctrine. This doctrine was comprised of three \nmain components which are deterrence, Early warning and rapid wars with decisive victory it is \nworth noting that these components are known as the security triad. However the major security \nchallenge after Israel's independence was the Arab hostility especially neighboring countries such \nas Egypt, Syria and Jordan. (Freilich, 2018) \n Since military doctrine is flexible and changes depending on the challenges facing nations, Israel \nhad many challenges that forced it to develop a doctrine in order to protect its national security. At \nthat time, Israel was geographically a small country with no natural borders and surrounded by \nhostile countries which making it vulnerable to any sudden attack, in addition to that the regional \nsize of Israel at that time was relatively small compared to the regional size of the hostile countries \nas the Arab armies were organized and large. Israel, on the other hand, suffered from a lack of \ntactical and strategic depth as well as small size army due to its small population. Beside the \nemergence of oil, Arabs were able to provide economic resources to maintain their armies and \nstrengthen their economic structure this led to create discrepancy between the two parties and \npushed the adoption of a military doctrine built on the Israel assumptions that the conflicts between \nIsrael and the Arab countries	ResearchGate
israel_doctrine_5	Israel		will not end using the military means also it is difficult to force the \nArabs to accept Israel’s existence and it is not easy for Israel to achieve any meaningful long-term \npolitical gains.  \nTherefore Israel maintained the status quo while attempting to secure its borders with an iron wall \nstrategy in order to protect the borders from enemies, In fact, the Iron Wall strategy is considered \none of the doctrine's effective long-term strategies, this was regarding internal strategy. (Freilich, \n5 \n \n2018) Despite the importance of the alliance with external powers, Israel has realized that its \nmilitary doctrine must be strategically independent and defend itself with the possibility of relying \non temporary alliances if necessary in order to maintain a balance between deterrence and wars \nprovided that external forces are not directly involved.  \nMoreover  alliances Israel adopted the term of “political time” which refers to  determining the \nappropriate periods for carrying out military operations before external intervention imposes a \nceasefire, Actually Israel relied on this strategy after several frustrating situations Perhaps the \nclosest example of this is France’s arms embargo in 1967 and the United States forcing Israel to \nwithdraw from Sinai twice, once in 1949 and again in 1967. (Freilich, 2018) \n As for the discrepancy between the confrontation countries and Israel, Israel resorted to \ncomprehensive military recruitment to fill this discrepancy and focused on professionals with \nmilitary experience, especially in areas that require high degrees of expertise, such as training \nreserve soldiers and formulating military doctrine. (Eilam, 2018) Nevertheless The classical \nmilitary doctrine was more like an unofficial doctrine and was transmitted orally through lectures, \nlaws, speeches, and Knesset decisions.  \n \nContemporary  Doctrine  \n \nIn 2006, several studies were conducted of the challenges expected to face Israel during the years \n2006 and 2016,	ResearchGate
israel_doctrine_6	Israel		the military doctrine for Israeli national security was formulated based on these \nstudies by Dan Modiron where the doctrine was officially adopted as an integrated long-term \nnational security doctrine. A fourth element has been added to the classic military doctrine, which \nis the element of defense, The classical doctrine was developed due to the type of wars \ntransformation from conventional wars to unconventional wars. \n In the past, Israel was able to succeed in confronting conventional wars and improved its ability \nto anticipate future events. Still, the processes of change in the strategic  environment require \nfurther development of the doctrine, especially with the emergence of Terrorism and \nunconventional weapons, doctrine must always be reviewed periodically. (Eldadi, 2019, p. 11)  \nDespite the peace treaties signed by neighboring countries with Israel, such as Egypt and Jordan \nfollowed by the fall of Syria and Iraq, Actually this led to reducing the traditional security \nchallenges resulting from Arab hostility size against Israel, Expect in light of the Arab Spring \nuprisings and of the Arab regimes fall that witnessed the second phase of transformation of the \nstrategic environments, that led to the emergence of stronger smaller factions and ineffective \ngroups such as Hezbollah and Hamas, which posing a new and different security risks to Israel. \n(Rodman, 2019)  \n6 \n \nThe Arab uprisings in the Arab Spring caused many changes in the strategic environments. In a  \ncase study conducted by Muhammad Badry Eid on the impact extent of internal political changes \non Israeli military doctrine in light of the Arab Spring uprisings 2011 which is a critical period of \ntransformation that cannot be skipped, the results revealed that the Arab uprisings changed the \nstructure of security threats and risks, affecting the Israel’s military doctrine , It had a direct long-\nterm impact on the overall regional strategic environment.  \nThe Arab uprisings created an	ResearchGate
israel_doctrine_7	Israel		unstable Middle Eastern strategic environment, which affected \nIsrael's security. There are also some challenges arising from the uprisings that may lead to a shift \nin doctrine, some of which is the Israel loss of regional allies, given Syria's geographical location \nnorth of Israel Iran's presence in the country under the pretext of supporting the Syrian regime \nposes a threat to Israel itself. Furthermore, the emergence of new leaders following the fall of the \nprevious regimes' presidents would make it difficult to restore strong relations and friendships \nbetween those countries and Israel, which were previously strained due to fear of retaliation, the \nuprisings also have changed the regional balance of power. (Eid, 2019) \nOver the decades, there have been many changes to the components of the Israeli military doctrine \ndue to changes in the strategic environment, starting with traditional wars such as the Arab Israeli-\nwar in 1967 and 1973 wars, the Palestinian Intifada and wars against Hezbollah in Lebanon, \nleading to the Arab uprisings and emergence of  unconventional wars, such as the increase in the \nprobability of strange military strikes as a result of the political Islam arrival  in light of the Arab \nSpring, as well as the expansion of the Syrian opposition into many areas of the regime which \nallowed Russia and Iran to put their military weight to insure  survival of the Assad regime. (Eid, \n2019) \nHowever, the components of the military doctrine expanded over decades to include: \n1)  Deterrence:  to prevent opponents from waging any open wars against Israel and defeating \nopponents with the least amount of human losses. \n2)  Early warning:  refers to warning the military leadership of any possible attack as soon as \npossible. \n3)  Adversary: refers to the importance of punishing enemies and preventing them from \nthreatening Israel's security once again. (transferring the battle to the enemy's territory is \nconsidered one of the strategies of this	ResearchGate
israel_doctrine_8	Israel		component) \n4) Offensive war of maneuver.  \n5)  Priority is always for short wars:  to reduce the possibility of external forces intervention \nmilitarily  and diplomatically  to put pressure on Israel ( the use of  political term strategy).  \n6) Great powers sponsorship : is an essential element that serves the deterrence component. \nSuch as Israel's currently relationship with the United States . \n7 \n \n \nIsrael's military doctrine objective : \n \nThe basic Objective of Israel’s doctrine is to serve Israeli’s security interests, Actually Israel’s \nmilitary doctrine is an essential tool for achieving many goals, including: \n1) Ensuring the State of Israel survival  \n2) Protecting Israel’s citizens and territorial integrity \n3)  Preserving Israel’s values and national character. \n4)  Preserving Israel’s social and economic strength as a developed country. \n5) Strengthening Israel’s international and regional standing. \n6) Seeking to achieve peace with neighboring countries. \n \nIsael’s military doctrine evolving during environmental changes :  \n \nThe strategic level could be considered as cornerstone of military doctrine. Therefore, military \nstrategy is an integral part of the doctrine, which in turn enhances nation’s political goals \nachievement . This is through its important role in defining doctrine’s goals, ensuring doctrine’s  \nadaptability and scalability according to changing circumstances, Maintaining logistical support, \nmilitary coordination, Ensuring the implementation of military operations in the right time and \nplace, coordination between allies and partners at the international level regarding a wide range of \nnaval, air, and land military activities, in addition to technology and cyber security in order to \navoid any failure in doctrine. (Tianliang, Science of military strategy , 2020)  \nOwing to the military strategy flexibility, it can smoothly develops to be adapted with strategic \nenvironments changes. However, The Israeli military strategy has	ResearchGate
israel_doctrine_9	Israel		experienced many changes and \ndevelopments in order to be adapted to strategic environments changes, especially in the military \nfields of land, air, naval, and special forces, in addition to the cyber security technology fields. \n \n• Military Ground strategy  \n \nIsrael has demonstrated its ability to effectively address conventional military challenges, \nshowcasing the flexibility and adaptability of its military doctrine. However, navigating non-\nstrategic environments presents a multifaceted challenge. Formative experiences gleaned from \nconflicts such as the Second Lebanon War in 2006 and the Cast Lead War in 2008 have profoundly \ninfluenced Israel's ground military strategy, particularly in response to the emergence of hybrid \nwarfare involving non-state actors and terrorist organizations. \n8 \n \nThe "Merkava tanks" serve as linchpins within the Israeli Defense Forces, particularly at the \ntactical level. An in-depth examination of their role in contemporary and hybrid warfare \nilluminates the evolution of Israel's military strategy. Following the suboptimal performance of \nMerkava tanks during the Second Lebanon War, the IDF embarked on structural reforms and the \nintegration of advanced weapon systems to better align with the exigencies of modern conflicts, \nnotably those involving Hezbollah and Hamas. Recognizing the necessity for a comprehensive \napproach encompassing combined arms tactics, especially in challenging terrains, enhancements \nwere made to Merkava armored vehicles, including reinforced armor, radar and laser detection \nsystems, and the adoption of sophisticated ammunition like the Kalanit 120-mm shell and the \nHatzav 120-mm shell. These adaptations were aimed at enhancing the vehicle's resilience against \nanti-tank threats.The refinement of the Israeli Defense Forces' organizational structure yielded \ntangible results during Operation Cast Lead in 2008, underscoring the effective assimilation of \nlessons learned from prior conflicts. Subsequent	ResearchGate
israel_doctrine_10	Israel		iterations of military strategy and force structure \ndevelopment further underscored Israel's capacity for adaptation and flexibility, exemplified by \nOperation Protective Edge in 2014. In this context, the upgraded Merkava tanks, equipped with \nthe Trophy Active Protection System, played a pivotal role in securing urban perimeters and tunnel \nnetworks. These advancements, coupled with comprehensive post-conflict assessments, \nunderscore Israel's ongoing commitment to refining its military capabilities in response to evolving \nthreats. (Kim, 2016) \nIn the foreseeable future, adversaries are anticipated to persist in employing underground warfare \nor tunnel warfare to exploit the vulnerabilities of conventional forces, Despite the longstanding \nhistorical precedent of ground warfare. Notably, in the context of World War II, the conflict \nbetween the United States and Japan in the Pacific theater witnessed significant casualties among \nAmerican forces due to tunnel warfare tactics. However, underground warfare is undergoing \nstrategic evolutions, increasingly embraced by non-state actors and terrorist entities, thereby \namplifying its threat to global security . (Daphné Richemond-Barak and Stefan Voiculescu-\nHolvad, 2023)  \nGiven the complexities posed by underground warfare, the Israeli military doctrine has seeked to \nimplement countermeasures commensurate with contemporary threats. As Israel has superior \ncapabilities in finding tunnels. This is due to its development of specialized units such as the \nYahalom unit, which specializes in dealing with secret wars and its possession of the latest radars, \nsensors and other modern systems, in addition to munitions capable of penetrating the ground and \nexplosives that help it find tunnels.   \nHowever, addressing the fiscal challenges associated with hybrid warfare against Hamas is \nanticipated to necessitate considerable time and resources, particularly given the disparate \ngeographical contexts of each conflict	ResearchGate
israel_doctrine_11	Israel		scenario. Effective engagement in asymmetric warfare \ndemands specialized capabilities adaptable to diverse terrains and circumstances. Consequently, \nthe military doctrine will persist in refining its strategic, operational, and tactical frameworks to \nensure adaptability to evolving exigencies, informed by comprehensive analyses of present \n9 \n \nconditions to inform future force structure development. (Spencer, UNDERGROUND \nNIGHTMARE: HAMAS TUNNELS AND THE WICKED PROBLEM FACING THE IDF, \n2023) \n• Air Force Strategy  \n \nThe Israeli Air Force has played a crucial role in ensuring the nation's survival and achieving \nvictory. With each battle, the reliance on air power grows, alongside advancements in military \ntactics and technology. \nWhile air power may be perceived as crude due to its destructive nature, it remains a potent tool \nfor the IDF. It enables the strict enforcement of deterrence and offers protection to Israeli ground \nforces, thus minimizing soldier casualties. The Israeli Air Force has demonstrated its effectiveness \nin conventional warfare, notably during the 1967 conflict with the Egyptian Air Force. This success \nhighlights the adaptability and rapid development of Israeli military doctrine through learning from \npast setbacks. (Carter, John R., 1998) \n In light of shifting strategic landscapes, there is a pressing need for continued development in \nforce structure and doctrine. In irregular warfare, ineffective actors or terrorists often exploit urban \nand densely populated areas deliberately. This necessitates countries to strategically employ air \npower as a primary force against them, albeit to a limited extent. ( Major General Amikam Norkin \nand Abraham Katsman, 2023) \nAs gathering intelligence is crucial for air force success, Israel has embraced the development of \nair force strategy through technological advancements and innovative tactics aimed at guiding \nprecise air strikes. Among these strategies, the utilization of unmanned aerial	ResearchGate
israel_doctrine_12	Israel		vehicles (UAVs) \nstands out. These UAVs are equipped with various sensor options and radar systems, allowing for \neffective intelligence gathering through battlefield surveillance and reconnaissance. This enables \ntimely and accurate information dissemination to both ground and air forces. Additionally, arming \nthese vehicles with combat weapons reduces pilot exposure to risks, thus enhancing operational \neffectiveness. Among the most significant examples of advanced UAVs are the Heron TP UAV, \nHermes 450 UAV, and Hermes 900 UAV. (RUSI, 2018) \nAside from drones, Israel possesses a range of exclusive fighter aircraft, including the American-\nmanufactured F-35, F-16, and F-15 models. These aircraft contribute to making the Israeli Air \nForce one of the most formidable globally, primarily due to their capability to execute long-range \nattack missions without refueling. Over the years, these aircraft have undergone continuous \ndevelopment and enhancement, adapting their defense capabilities to meet evolving military \nobjectives. The latest addition to this fleet is the F-35A variant. (Brower, 2018) \nConsidering the ongoing wars and threats, as well as the insights gained from past experiences and \nfuture projections, it is anticipated that the Israeli Air Force will undergo substantial expansion. \nThis growth will be facilitated by plans to enhance the capabilities of Israeli domestic production, \n10 \n \naiming for self-sufficiency. Additionally, financial strategies will be implemented to procure \nadvanced helicopters and aircraft, including an increase in the acquisition of combat aircraft such \nas the F-35 and upgraded F-15 models, along with expanding the stock of air ammunition. \n \n• Navy Military strategy  \n \nThe Israeli coastline, overlooking the Mediterranean Sea, holds significant geopolitical \nsignificance due to its strategic positioning amidst essential Israeli infrastructure. It hosts five \nwater desalination facilities, crucial for providing fresh water,	ResearchGate
israel_doctrine_13	Israel		alongside marine rigs facilitating \nthe delivery of natural gas to the shore. This gas is subsequently utilized in power plants to generate \nelectricity. Moreover, a vast majority of vital imports arrive in Israel via the Mediterranean Sea. \nNotably, the discovery of substantial gas reserves between 2009 and 2012 has paved the way for \nIsrael's potential self-sufficiency and even export capabilities. Anticipated trends suggest a \ngrowing reliance on the Mediterranean Sea for Israel in the years ahead. (Petrakis, 2019) \nHence, safeguarding the Mediterranean shoreline holds paramount significance, compelling Israel \nto devise naval military tactics and guarantee optimal maritime defense. Indeed, the Israeli Navy \nstands as a cornerstone of strategic prowess, playing a central role in bolstering the Israeli military \ndoctrine. Israel has demonstrated its capacity to counter conventional naval adversaries, \nexemplified by its decisive triumph in the 1973 Battle of Latakia, employing electronic warfare \ntechniques. This victory underscores the efficacy and adaptability of the military doctrine in crisis \nsituations. Nevertheless, the strategic landscape has undergone substantial transformation with the \nrise of new security challenges, including non-state actors and terrorist organizations. Particularly \nconcerning is the potential possession of weaponry by these groups capable of posing threats to \noffshore drilling platforms. Hence, there arose a necessity to evolve the Israeli naval military \nstrategy to effectively address contemporary shifts. Moreover, the Second Lebanon War in 2006 \nserves as a poignant catalyst for refining military doctrine based on invaluable lessons gleaned \nfrom that experience. (Labbin, 2023) \nIn past conventional naval conflicts, Israel adhered to a blue water strategy, typically emphasizing \noperations in deep oceans, power projection, and long-range endeavors. This approach entailed \nasserting control over extensive sea lanes through naval	ResearchGate
israel_doctrine_14	Israel		patrols, safeguarding vital shipping routes, \nand exerting maritime influence across significant distances. However, a discernible shift is now \napparent. The transition and evolution of the Israeli naval strategy towards embracing a brown \nwater approach are evident. Unlike the blue water strategy, the brown water strategy concentrates \non coastal regions and inland waterways, aligning closely with its primary objectives: defense, \ncoastal protection, piracy deterrence, and ground force support. This refined brown water strategy \nfacilitates seamless threat coordination across air, sea, and land branches, enabling automatic \nsharing of information based on the branch that first detects the target. (Labbin, 2023) \n11 \n \nAnd to support this advanced strategy, the Megan project stands out as a key initiative embraced \nby the Israeli Naval Forces, exemplifying cutting-edge military doctrine. A prime illustration of \nthis is the acquisition of the German-manufactured Sa'ar 6 class warships, which significantly \nbolster the defensive capabilities of the Israeli Navy. These vessels, notable for their size and \nequipped with the IAI-Elta radar system, greatly enhance threat detection capabilities, spanning \nenemy missiles, defense systems, and projectiles.  \nMoreover, the system encompasses electronic warfare functionalities and will feature 76 mm \ncannons alongside multiple weapons stations. Israel further strives for 95% of the sophisticated \ndefense systems integrated into naval vessels to be domestically produced, underscoring the \ndoctrine's commitment to self-reliance. Moreover, the contemporary Sa'ar 6-class warships are \npoised to serve as a virtual bulwark amidst present-day threats, particularly in their capability to \nseamlessly share data with ground and air forces, thus enhancing coordination and response \nefficiency. (Lappin b. Y., 2021) \nGiven the prevailing advancements, it is anticipated that the Israeli Navy will transition towards a \ncombat doctrine	ResearchGate
israel_doctrine_15	Israel		tailored to address contemporary regional threats and anticipate future challenges. \nIts pivotal role will encompass engaging with adversaries and swiftly identifying targets. \nMoreover, integration of state technology is foreseen to be paramount in aligning strategy with \nanticipated scenarios, ensuring preparedness for evolving circumstances. \n \n• Cyber Defense strategy  \n \nIn today's world, with ongoing conflicts and evolving strategic landscapes, cyberspace has gained \nsignificant importance alongside traditional fields. including state actors and non-state actors such \nas terrorist groups, have leveraged cyberspace, presenting new challenges to military strategies \nworldwide.  \nAnnually, the Israeli Defense Forces encounter numerous cyber-attacks aimed at compromising \ntheir defenses, systems, and computer networks. These attacks encompass a range of military \nactivities, both covert and operational, posing significant security threats and undermining critical \nmilitary capabilities. For instance, in 2020, Ben Gurion Airport experienced cyber-attacks that \nsignificantly disrupted flights to Israel, posing sensitive security risks. Israel also grapples with \nconcerns over potentially harmful cyber elements in weapons manufactured abroad, This includes \nAmerican aircraft and German-made warships, prompting the IDF to conduct decontamination \nmeasures post-delivery. (Charles D. Freilich, Matthew S. Cohen, and Gabi Siboni, 2023) \nHowever, Israel recognizes the significance of early investment and advancement in cyberspace \nand has demonstrated the effectiveness of this approach through successful implementation of its \ndoctrine. A notable illustration is Operation Orchard in 2007, where Israel uncovered collaborative \nefforts between Syria and North Korea aimed at developing nuclear weapons in Syria, posing a \n12 \n \ngrave security concern. In response, Israel swiftly deployed numerous combat and modern \nelectronic warfare aircraft. Leveraging these electronic	ResearchGate
israel_doctrine_16	Israel		warfare capabilities, Israel successfully \nneutralized the nuclear facilities, in order to protect its security interests. (GROSS, 2018) \nNevertheless, Studies have indicated a direct correlation between cyberattacks on Israel and \nescalating military tensions. As tensions increase, there's a corresponding rise in the frequency of \ncyberattacks. This trend was evident during the major conflicts between Israel and Hamas in 2009, \n2012, and 2014. Consequently, the Israeli Defense Forces continue to refine their cyberspace \ndefense strategies, recognizing that cyber threats can emanate from both state actors like Iran and \nnon-state actors like Hamas and Hezbollah. (CURTIS E. LEMAY CENTER for doctrine \ndevelopment and education) \nHowever, Israel recognized early on the significance of investing in cybersecurity and underwent \nvarious stages of development to craft adaptable strategies for every evolving scenario. Despite \nthe increasing pace of global cyberattacks, Israel established the National Information Security \nAuthority (NISA) in 2002. This authority's mission is to coordinate defense efforts against \ncyberattacks, safeguard Israel's infrastructure, and pursue ongoing research and development of \nstrategic security defense strategies.  \nIn 2011, Israel made an official declaration recognizing cyberspace as a new domain of warfare, \nhighlighting the critical need for the development of defense strategies against cyber-attacks, \nparticularly in light of evolving battlegrounds alongside the escalating threats and advancements \nin technology. This announcement has led to the prioritization of bolstering scientific and \ntechnological cybersecurity capabilities. This entails a focus on research and development, as well \nas fortifying the national science and technology infrastructure in the realm of cyberspace.   \nIn 2012, as a response, Israel initiated the development of its Cyber Defense Strategy. This strategy \nsaw the establishment of the Israeli National Cyber	ResearchGate
israel_doctrine_17	Israel		Office, which aimed to enhance cybersecurity \nefforts by centralizing coordination, fostering information exchange among stakeholders, and \nfostering innovation in the cybersecurity domain. Progress in Israeli cybersecurity persisted, \nleading to a pivotal decision in 2015 to launch a comprehensive national cybersecurity program. \n This program aimed to bolster Israel's defensive capabilities against cyber threats, improve \ncoordination among government agencies, private sectors, and infrastructure sectors, and advance \nspecialized research in cybersecurity defense strategies. The primary objective of this decision is \nfor Israel to assert itself as a global leader in cybersecurity and to fortify the security of its \ninfrastructure. \n In line with the evolving landscape and advancements in Israeli space security strategies, the \nestablishment of the National Center for Cyber Security (NCSA) ensued. This center represents an \nevolution of prior strategies, aimed at refining and enhancing efforts to defend against cyberattacks \nwith greater precision and efficacy. (PRIME MINISTER’S OFFICE NATIONAL CYBER \nDIRECTORATE, 2017) \n13 \n \n    \n \nThis timeline of continuous development underscores the validity of the Israeli military doctrine \nand its notable flexibility and adaptability. Despite significant efforts, Israeli cyber defense \nencounters ongoing challenges, particularly due to the dynamic nature of evolving battlefields and \nstrategic environments. Nevertheless, Israel is poised to enhance its cyber defense capabilities, \nensuring the fulfillment of national security interests and the protection of critical infrastructure. \nThis progress is anticipated to stem from continued innovation in the field of cybersecurity. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n14 \n \nIsrael's Current  Regional Challenges  \n \nPresently, Isael’s military doctrine is confronted with two main challenges that could represents a \npotential threat to its national security. \n \nI. \nIran’s process of obtaining	ResearchGate
israel_doctrine_18	Israel		nuclear capabilities \nThe Iranian nuclear program consider as a major concern for Israel today. Israel sees a nuclear-\narmed Iran as a direct threat to its security and survival. Iran's pursuit of nuclear capabilities aims \nto assert its dominance in the Middle East. Additionally, Iran supports terrorist groups like \nHezbollah and Hamas, potentially supplying them with nuclear weapons to target Israel. This poses \na significant security risk to Israel, especially if these groups engage in proxy wars on Iran's behalf. \nThis situation not only poses an existential threat to Israel but also alters the strategic balance in \nthe Middle East. Although the nuclear deal with major powers, mainly the United States, reduced \nthe threat, America's recent withdrawal raises concerns about its effectiveness. Israel needs to keep \na close eye on Iran's actions and continue engaging in dialogue and cooperation with major powers \nto prevent Iran from getting nuclear weapons. This involves supporting international sanctions, \nparticularly those imposed by the United States and the global community. (Eldadi, 2019, p. 21) \nIt’s expected that Israel will strengthen its defenses to stop and protect itself from any potential \ndanger in the future. Since reaching an agreement with Iran to halt uranium enrichment seems \nimprobable, it's crucial to negotiate a fair deal that limits such activities and shuts down facilities \nlike Fordow, while also ensuring effective monitoring. This approach is reinforced to prevent \nmilitary action against Iran. (Jalal, 2023) \nThe recent Iranian attack on Israel on April 13, 2024, marks a significant shift in global dynamics. \nThis event demonstrates a changing landscape in both strategic environments and battlefields. \nDespite this, Israel has showcased its military prowess and the effectiveness of its defense \nstrategies. Through advancements in missile defense systems, including anti-aircraft drones and \nballistic missile interception technology, Israel	ResearchGate
israel_doctrine_19	Israel		successfully intercepted around 95% of the attack. \nThis success underscores the effectiveness of its doctrine and its ongoing development. However, \nIsrael and its allies should not assume lasting safety. Given the rapidly shifting strategic landscapes, \nIsrael faces heightened threats, particularly from terrorist groups backed by Iran. These groups \nengage in proxy warfare across multiple regions, including Hamas and Islamic Jihad in Gaza, \nHezbollah in Lebanon, and militias in Iraq and Yemen.  \nAs Iran advances its potential to acquire nuclear weapons, the threat to security escalates. Hence, \nIsrael should persist in refining its military strategies and collaborating with allies to enhance \ndeterrence. Embracing the concept of deterrence through punitive measures may suit the present \nscenario better. This approach entails imposing significant costs on adversaries and prioritizing \nretaliatory actions against key targets. (Jacob Nagel & Mark Dubowitz, 2024) \n15 \n \nII. \nThe continuation of the Palestinian conflict and negative impacts resulting from the \nconflict . \n \n The relationship between Israel and Palestine brings many difficulties for Israel's military \ndoctrine. The ongoing conflict between them creates problems both domestically and globally. It \nalso poses a long-term challenge for Israel's goal of staying both democratic and Jewish, as the \nconflict involves regional, national, religious, and cultural aspects. However It's important to \nmention that the closeness of Israel and Palestine makes the Palestinian conflict a constant and real \nthreat. Israel's military strategy aims to protect national security interests, through: maintaining \nIsrael's Jewish and democratic identity, establishing recognized international borders, fostering \nmoderate Palestinian leadership that seeks political harmony with Israel, preventing Palestinian \nterritories from becoming hubs for anti-Israeli terrorism, safeguarding airspace from hostile \nactions, nurturing positive	ResearchGate
israel_doctrine_20	Israel		relations with the Arab world, lessening Palestinian reliance on Israel, \nand building strong alliances with neighboring nations like Jordan. These guidelines outlined in \nthe Israeli military doctrine aim to advance national interests. (Eldadi, 2019) \nRecently, the events of October 7 serve as a test to assess the recent developments in Israeli military \ndoctrine, particularly regarding positions on military deterrence, intelligence assessment for early \nwarning, and the feasibility of self-sufficiency and ongoing security strategies. This evaluation \nprovides a solid starting point for formulating security hypotheses and perceptions. To ensure a \nfuture that aligns with the demands of the modern era and draws from past lessons, it's crucial to \nadapt doctrinal strategies to current circumstances. This involves studying the latest activities of \nterrorist groups like Hamas and Hezbollah, recognizing that battlefields and strategic environments \nare dynamic elements requiring constant updates and security solutions.

It lays out the important ideas that \nguide how military units work together to achieve the goals of the nation. It covers everything \nfrom big-picture strategies to day-to-day tactics. The main job of military doctrine is to keep the \ncountry safe and protect its sovereignty. (Spencer, WHAT IS ARMY DOCTRINE?, 2017) The \nmain aims of Israel's military doctrine are to keep the country safe, protect its people and territory, \nuphold its values and national identity, and boost its strength at home and abroad. It also focuses \non building good relationships with neighboring countries for security. Over time, Israel's military \nstrategy has	ResearchGate
israel_doctrine_22	Israel		evolved, mainly due to ongoing tensions with Arab neighbors and traditional warfare \ntactics. Despite challenges, Israel has shown the effectiveness of its military approach through past \nvictories and peace agreements, such as those with Egypt and Jordan. (Eid, 2019) \nHowever, shifts in the strategic landscape led Israel to analyze the anticipated challenges from \n2006 to 2016. This analysis eventually led to the formal announcement of its modern military \ndoctrine. The Arab uprisings marked a significant change in the strategic environment, introducing \nsecurity threats that endangered Israel. These uprisings contributed to instability across the Middle \nEast region, prompting Israel to reassess its security posture. (Eldadi, 2019) \nIt worth to mention the importance of doctrine’s military strategy which plays a vital role within \nits framework. Israel's ability to adjust its military strategy has facilitated its smooth evolution to \naddress ongoing changes, particularly in land, air, naval, and space security domains. For instance, \nthe adaptation of Merkava tanks, fundamental to the Israeli Defense Forces, illustrates this \nflexibility. The enhancements made to these tanks have yielded tangible outcomes, showcasing the \nadaptability of the military doctrine. Israel remains dedicated to enhancing its military capabilities \nin response to evolving threats, particularly in terms of land strategy. (Kim, 2016) Moreover,  \ntunnel o underground warfare has been recognized as a significant threat, while tunnel warfare is \nnot a new phenomenon, the shift from traditional to hybrid warfare has increased the risks \nassociated with tunnel warfare, particularly when utilized by terrorist groups like Hamas. (Daphné \nRichemond-Barak and Stefan Voiculescu-Holvad, 2023) \nIn addition, to support the advancement of Israeli military strategies, Israel boasts cutting-edge \nfighter aircraft like the F-13, F-16, and F-35, which contribute to its status as one of the world's \nmost	ResearchGate
israel_doctrine_23	Israel		formidable air forces. Furthermore, its naval defense capabilities have been bolstered with \nadvanced German warships, such as the Sa'ar 6 class, equipped with Israeli security defense \nsystems, making up 95% of its construction to serve as an exclusive defensive asset. Israel's \nmilitary doctrine has demonstrated its adaptability by seamlessly integrating updates to traditional \nmilitary strategies. Additionally, Israel has emerged as a global leader in modern areas, notably \nspace security, through the implementation of strategies aimed at enhancing defense against \nongoing cyber threats. (PRIME MINISTER’S OFFICE NATIONAL CYBER DIRECTORATE, \n2017) \n18 \n \nRegarding the current challenges, Israel is currently facing two main challenges: Iran’s process of \nobtaining nuclear weapons and the Palestinian issue, both of which are considered a threat to Israeli \nnational security. Since the military doctrine is characterized by flexibility and adaptation, it is \nexpected that the Israeli military doctrine will witness further development based on the lessons \nlearned from previous experiences and studies on current situations.

china_Naval_doctrine_0	China	Naval	Chinese Naval doctrine\nIn 2004, China released a white paper addressing current national security \nchallenges and Chinese security scenarios. As a result of its isolation at the time, \nChina focused on creating smaller but more potent forces, while reforming and \ncondensing the PLAN’s (People’s Liberation Army, Navy) entire structure and \nchain of command. The development of more comprehensive marine forces, \nespecially amphibious combat units, was also prioritized. Additionally, PLAN \nmodified its focus to put more of an emphasis on creating information-driven, \nlong-range precision attack capabilities. In its white paper from 2006, the PLAN \naims to gradually increase the strategic depth for offshore defensive operations \nwhile emphasizing coordinated marine operations and strategic counterattacks. \nPLAN sought to build mobile marine forces, provide combined and integrated \nmaritime assistance, and enhance its overall capacity for operations in coastal \nseas. The PLAN, PLA Air force, PLA rocket forces, and the PLA itself are all \nincluded in the scope of all doctrinal objectives and revisions of the Chinese \nmilitary. Instead of utilizing any specific nomenclature for doctrine, Chinese \nmilitary scientists published the article under the categories “operational theory” \nand “operational practice.” Two essential components of PLA doctrine are the \nBasic Military Theory and the Applied Military Theory. The former outlines the \nfundamental concepts that guide modern military and strategic operations, \nwhile the later details how all such written regulations are really put into \npractice.\nA new “operational level” called “Active Defense” () is also described in the PLAN \ndocument. This level is primarily utilized to conduct “Local Wars Under Modern \nHigh-Tech Conditions.” To safeguard the security and safety of marine routes, \nPLAN provides yet another crucial strategic recommendation known as “Off-\nshore defense”. \nOff-shore defense:\nA PLAN element of the “Active	Modern Diplomacy - Fatima Arshad
china_Naval_doctrine_1	China	Naval	Defense” strategic directives known as “Offshore \nDefense” was approved by the CMC in 1985. It elaborates the following 7 most \nimportant elements, that utilizes the Chinese military forces.\n•Our military’s overall approach is defensive. Only after being attacked do, we \nattack. But we engage in offensive actions.\n•“Neither time nor space will be a barrier to our counteroffensive.”\n•“We won’t set restrictions on how far our offensives can go.”\n•“When we do begin offensive operations, we will wait for the time and \ncircumstances that suit our forces.”\n•“We will concentrate on the weak points of the enemy army and use our own \ntroops to destroy the opponent’s forces,”\n•We’ll simultaneously conduct offensive operations against the opposition and \ndefensive actions to safeguard our own forces.\n•In accordance with PLA literature, PLAN has the following three crucial \nmissions:\n•Preserve territorial sovereignty of the country\n•Safeguard marine rights and the unity of the motherland\n•Keep the enemy at bay and fend off seaborne invasions\nThree Attacks and Three Defenses\nThe Chinese military also developed the “Three Attacks and Three \nDefenses” strategy, where “Three Attacks” stood for attacks against vehicles, \naircraft, and airborne forces, and “Three Defenses” stood for protection against \nchemical, biological, and nuclear attack.\nThe “New Three Defenses” and the “New Three Attacks,” which are attacks using \ncruise missiles, armed helicopters, and stealth aircraft, were both reintroduced \nby the PLA, there were defences against electronic jamming, precise strikes, and \nelectronic snooping and surveillance in 1999.\nA2/AD strategy:\nThe goal of A2/AD is to limit the opponent freedom of movement on the \nbattlefield. Area restriction is the practice of limiting the enemy freedom to act in \nregions under cooperative control by employing defensive measures such as air \nand sea defense systems Anti-access operations employ attack aircraft, \nbattleships, and specialist ballistic	Modern Diplomacy - Fatima Arshad
china_Naval_doctrine_2	China	Naval	and cruise missiles designed to strike key \ntargets. The two regions where China’s A2/AD is most focused are Taiwan and \nthe South China Sea.\nChina utilizes increasingly sophisticated land-attack ballistic and cruise missiles \nto prevent access to US military facilities on Guam and the Japanese island of \nOkinawa China has used anti-ship cruise and ballistic missile types that, thanks \nto improved re-entry vehicle technology, can strike precisely and avoid most sea-\nbased missile defense systems China’s anti-ship cruise missiles are intercepted \nby warships, submarines, and planes patrolling the waterways off its coastline. \nIn contrast, China utilizes fighter jets and a sophisticated system of air and \nmissile defense platforms. Area denial capacity is still maintained by China, and \nsources say the nation plans to buy updated S-400 air defense systems from \nRussia.\nMaritime/Naval Disputes\nThere have been ongoing maritime conflicts between China and other nations. \nAlthough the geopolitics of the Cold War and Japan’s loss in the Second World \nWar complicated the island’s claims, the Diaoyu/Senkaku Island controversy in \nthe East China Sea dates back to the Sino-Japanese War in 1894. A protracted \nsequence of incidents rooted in Southeast Asian history have been caused by \ncompeting exclusive economic zones in the South China Sea.\nChina’s territorial or resource claims in the South China Sea have been the focal \npoint of three interconnected but separate maritime conflicts between China and \nother nations. This hearing’s primary subjects are the Sino-Japanese standoff \nover rival marine resource claims and sovereign control of the Senkaku/Diaoyu \nislands northeast of Taiwan, Instead of the Taiwan problem, which is up for \ndebate, there is some sort of maritime dispute, along with the complex web of \ntensions between Beijing and various Southeast Asian states (Vietnam, the \nPhilippines, Malaysia, and Brunei).\nThe actions of naval military operations in China’s	Modern Diplomacy - Fatima Arshad
china_Naval_doctrine_3	China	Naval	Exclusive Economic Zone and \nnon-demarcated “near seas” (jinhai), including the U.S. Navy’s ISR operations \nand drills along China’s coastline, linked concerns expressed above a white \nPLAN naval transits and the rising PLAN deployment across critical waterways \nnear other states, as well as disputed interpretations of the rights of other navies \nto function in Economic zone, are some of the more controversial topics \n(UNCLOS).\nThe “first island chain,” which spans from Japan to Southeast Asia, is also \naffected by a third group of issues that are more strategic in character but have \nnot yet escalated to the point of a formal dispute. Many of these problems are a \nresult of a conflict between China’s recent development of the capacity to \nchallenge some aspects of that dominance and the United States’ long-held \nconviction that maintaining military dominance in the western Pacific is \nnecessary. This conflict is primarily due to China’s deployment of increasingly \npotent “counter intervention” or anti access, area denial (A2/AD)-type weapons \nsystems along its maritime border.\nRegional and Global Ambitions\nThe People’s Republic of China is developing a potent naval force that will be \nable to manage its adjacent waterways, quell local disturbances, keep an eye on \nimportant sea lanes, and protect its substantial political and commercial \ninterests outside of East Asia. China’s ambitions on a regional and global scale \nall collide with US goals.\nChina is susceptible to marine traffic disruptions since it only uses the South \nChina Sea. President Hu Jintao, who was in office at the time, emphasized the \nnecessity for China to take fresh measures to combat the threat posed by “some \nmajor powers” aiming to control the Strait of Malacca in 2003. Following that, \nHu Jintao’s potential risk received significant attention in the Chinese media, \nand Chinese intellectuals emphasized the importance of researching into \nalternate marine routes in order to overcome the	Modern Diplomacy - Fatima Arshad

China has \nsupported robust domestic economy and shown a readiness to undertake \nsignificant projects to improve commerce, infrastructure, and other BRI \nconnectivity components. Global trade, investment, and finance are significantly \nimpacted by the BRI.\nThe PRC’s interests in the South and East China Seas have absolutely nothing to \ndo with its distant oceans, which are significant to its dreams for a worldwide \npresence. Achieving complete control, regional superiority, and sovereignty over \nthe nearby waterways are among China’s objectives. China is worried about \nmaintaining the vital interests of its government, the protection of its trade, and \nthe safety of Chinese workers everywhere in the world for its distant seas. \nChina’s Belt Road Initiative More than 60% of the world’s population is \nimpacted by BRI, which spans three continents.

In this regard, \nthe Gulf War in 1991 was the key development \nthat pushed China to undergo a major modern-\nization in the 1990s.15 The military operation of \nthe U.S.-led coalition that defeated the Iraqi mil-\nitary in a short time was a shocking development \nfor the then-Chinese military elite who observed \n14.

According-\nly, China’s military doctrines had been designed \nfor countering a territorial occupation in which \nthe PLA would exploit its numerical superior-\nity in close combat over a foreign force invad-\ning the Chinese mainland. After the Gulf War, \nChina started to shrink the size of its land force \nto a certain extent and devote more resources \nto building a more professional, technologically \nwell-equipped, and well-trained army. \n        \nAnother key development that pushed \nChina to modernize its military was the politi-\ncal status of Taiwan. During the Taiwan Strait \nCrisis in 1997, China failed to deter the U.S. in-\nvolvement in the crisis. After that, China started \nto develop anti-ship missiles to deal better with \npotential U.S. aircraft attack groups. According \nto recent Pentagon reports, China continues to \ndevelop advanced medium-range conventional \nballistic missiles, long-range anti-attack and anti-\nship navigation missiles called anti-access/area de-\nnial (A2/AD) capabilities in military science, and \nanti-satellite and aggressive cyber capabilities.16\nCHINA’S EVOLVING \nCONVENTIONAL  \nMILITARY DOCTRINE\nFrom its founding in 1949 to 1993, China ad-\nopted seven military doctrines.

It conceived of three phases of war: \nstrategic defense, strategic stalemate, and strate-\ngic counter-offense.18 Moreover, a people’s war \nwould be “fought with a triadic force composed \nof the main forces (the regular forces), the local \nforces and the guerrilla forces.”19  \nDuring the late Cold War period, the Chi-\nnese military underwent two major innovations. \nFirst, China adopted the “People’s War under \nModern Conditions Doctrine” in 1980. The doc-\ntrine adopted in 1993 represents the second ma-\njor innovation for the Chinese military. The 1980 \ndoctrine was a significant departure from the \nprevious doctrines despite retaining the label of \n“people’s war.” The essence of people’s war is de-\nfeating the enemy in an attrition war by drawing \nenemy forces into interior China.20 On the other \n17.

As the \nprevious doctrines were based on countering a	Foundation for Political, Economic and Social Research (SETA)

The doc-\ntrine was offensive as it held “the first strike” to \ntake advantage of adversary forces. Thus, it was \nnot reactive like the previous doctrines, but an \nactive warfighting doctrine.\nTHE 1993 DOCTRINE:  \nWINNING LOCAL WARS UNDER \nHIGH-TECHNOLOGY CONDITIONS\nThe 1993 doctrine was the second major inno-\nvation of the Chinese military after the 1980 \ndoctrine.

china__doctrine_12	China		departure from \nthe previous people’s war concept of the Chinese \nmilitary in several ways. First, as opposed to the \nlengthy temporal understanding of the people’s \nwar doctrine, it envisioned a “quick” war rather \nthan the annihilation of the enemy in a war of \nattrition. Second, it emphasized strength over \nweakness. The people’s war doctrine was based \non the fact that the Chinese would have been \nthe inferior side in a war against the invader. \nThird, the doctrine highlighted the importance \nof striking first instead of the people’s war con-\ncept of “striking after the enemy has struck.” \nFourth, it emphasized strategic deterrence, \nwhich is based on nuclear retaliation.22 Finally, \nthe doctrine underlined the role of elite troops \ninstead of the “human sea” understanding of \nMao’s people’s war.\nMoreover, the adoption of “joint opera-\ntions” as the main form of operation was one \nof the key aspects of the 1993 doctrine. In the \nprevious doctrines, the main forms of opera-\ntion ranged from positional defense to mobile \nand guerrilla warfare. Joint operations require \nthe involvement of three service branches un-\nder a centralized command and control struc-\nture in the battlefield. Such operations further \nrequire the establishment of new organization-\n21. Li, “The PLA’s Evolving Warfighting Doctrine, Strategy and Tactics, \n1985–1995”, p. 445.\n22.

Previ-\nously, the PLA had valued the role of the land \nforces, as prior military doctrines were mostly \nbased on ground warfare. The concept of joint \noperations, on the other hand, highlights the \nrole of air force and navy as well. So, the new \ndoctrine redefined the relationship between \nthe three services.\nFurther, the focus on limited wars on the \nperiphery was a central change for the Chinese \nmilitary.

With this doctrine, China \nadopted a theory of victory not only in its terri-\ntory but also in its periphery. The doctrine also \nwas a message that China can invoke military \nconflict with its neighbors in case of a crisis.\nTHE 2004 DOCTRINE: \nWINNING LOCAL WARS UNDER \nINFORMATIONIZED CONDITIONS\nIn 2004, China adopted a new military doctrine \ncalled “Winning Local Wars under Informatized \nConditions.” This doctrinal change, however, \nwas not a radical departure from the predeces-\nsor 1993 doctrine. The doctrine introduces \nthe concept of “informatization” replacing the \nphrase “high-technological conditions.”23 Infor-\nmatization basically refers to the coordination \nof the armed services conducting joint opera-\ntions. While the 1993 doctrine introduced the \nconcept of joint operations, the 2004 doctrine \nemphasized the coordinated information flow \nbetween services conducting joint operations. \nTo conduct such operations, the doctrine in-\nstructed the Chinese military to invest in de-\nveloping command, control, communications, \n23.

Put differently, the doctrine \naimed to guide the military’s adaptation to \nthe concept of system of systems warfare with \nthe advent of RMA.\nSimilar to the 1993 doctrine, the 2004 doc-\ntrine also envisaged a local war in China’s periph-\n24.

The identified types of military campaigns \nwere island assault, island blockade, and bor-\nder area counterattack campaigns.25 The focus \non “island” as the theater of operations reflects \nChina’s political and strategic concerns about \nTaiwan. The doctrine was offensive in the sense \nthat it envisaged a conventional Chinese assault \non an island, likely Taiwan.\nThe authoritative but unofficial publication \nThe Science of Campaigns, which was published \nby the PLA’s National Defense University in \n2006, identifies the conventional military opera-\ntions that the PLA could conduct. Table 4 shows \noperation types for each service.\nTHE 2014 DOCTRINE:  \nWINNING INFORMATIONIZED \nLOCAL WARS\nChina’s most recent military doctrine called \n“Winning Informationized Local Wars” was ad-\nopted in 2014. The new doctrine is an “active \ndefense” doctrine. China’s strategic guideline, \nreleased in 2015, describes it as “adherence to \nthe principles of defense, self-defense and post-\nemptive strike; and adherence to the stance that \n‘We will not attack unless we are attacked, but \nwe will surely counterattack if attacked.’26 While \ndefensive in strategic posture, the new doctrine \nhighlights the role of offensive missions at tacti-\ncal and operational levels.\nThe 2014 doctrine does not represent \na major departure from its predecessors –the \n2004 and 1993 doctrines– as it emphasizes \nthe role of flexibility, mobility, integrated joint \noperations, information dominance, and pre-\n25.

Currently, the 2014 doctrine holds \nan assertive and self-dependent stance for \nChina’s near maritime and territorial interests. \nWhen it comes to China’s overseas interests, \nthe doctrine has a less ambitious stance as the \nstrategic guideline underlines “international \nsecurity cooperation” to maintain such in-\nterests.31  This shows that China is still pre-\nparing for building the capacity to conduct \noverseas military operations. Besides increas-\ning the number of weapon systems, China is \nalso developing the quality of its naval weap-\non systems by investing in both domestic and \nforeign systems. However, China’s top priority \nremains preparing for local wars that would \nbe fought in its periphery.

CHINA’S NAVAL CAPACITY (2005-2019)\nSource: China Naval Modernization: Implications for U.S. Navy Capabilities - Background and Issues for Congress, Congressional Research Service \nReport, September 24, 2019. \nCONCLUSION\nThis study has shown that as its power increases, \nChina’s military doctrine has evolved in line with \nthe expansion of its political goals at interna-\ntional and regional levels. China’s military doc-\ntrine has evolved from a sheer defensive stance \nenvisaging a total war to a more offensive stance \nenvisaging limited war in the periphery.\nChina’s military innovation is often both a \nresponse to the changing international environ-\nment and a function of its increasing power. Ac-\ncordingly, with the decline of the Soviet Union \nand the concomitant reform process initiated by \nDeng Xiaoping, China found a strategic oppor-\ntunity to modernize its military. This brought its \nfirst major innovation during the late Cold War \nperiod: the 1980 doctrine. However, China’s most \nradical military innovation came in 1993. The \ncollapse of the Soviet Union and the Gulf War \npushed the Chinese elites to change the military \ndoctrine of the time. The technological superior-\nity of the U.S. military in the Gulf War forced \nChina to modernize its military into a more	Foundation for Political, Economic and Social Research (SETA)

The \nthree doctrines adopted after the Cold War show \nthat China is still far from conducting global op-\nerations, but is focused on a local war - one that \ninvolves Taiwan and probably the United States. \nThe content of the recent doctrines also suggests \nthat China is increasingly preparing for winning \nlocal wars by conducting offensive operations.\n216\n221\n222\n233\n262\n276\n276\n271\n273\n283\n294\n303\n317\n306\n335\n0\n50\n100\n150\n200\n250\n300\n350\n400\n2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019\nANKARA   •   İSTANBUL   •   WASHINGTON D.C.   •   CAIRO   •   BERLIN   •   BRUSSELS\nThis study examines China’s conventional military doctrine and its evolution \nafter the Cold War. If its current economic rise continues, China’s strategic \nposture and approach to war will be one of the key variables of international \npolitics. To make sense of China’s current foreign policy stance and potential \nfuture behavior regarding war, the following questions need to be answered: \nWhat military means, if necessary, would China employ in case of a war? \nWhere is a military threat to China likely to come from? What are the strate-\ngically important battle spaces for China? How does China plan to use mili-\ntary means in those domains? \nMilitary doctrines stand as reliable and useful sources to answer these ques-\ntions. Regarding China’s military doctrine, this study proposes two interre-\nlated arguments. First, as its power has increased, the evolution of China’s \nmilitary doctrine proves that China has adopted a more assertive and active \nstance on issues and regions. The Chinese military’s doctrinal innovation \nkeeps up with China’s diversifying interests and growing capacity. Second, \nthough China is a major power in North and Southeast Asia, the time is not \nyet ripe for	Foundation for Political, Economic and Social Research (SETA)

China’s most recent military doctrines are \ndesigned to deal with local challenges. This implies that the Chinese military \nstill does not feel that the country is likely to fight a global maritime or ter-\nritorial war in the near future.\nBEKİR İLHAN\nCHINA’S EVOLVING  \nMILITARY DOCTRINE\nAFTER THE COLD WAR\nwww.setav.org\nANALYSIS	Foundation for Political, Economic and Social Research (SETA)

The primary role of the Indian Army is to preserve\nNational interests and safeguard sovereignty, territorial integrity and\nunity of India against external threats and internal subversion by\ndeterrence or by waging war. The primary approach of our Nation is to\nresolve disputes in an amicable manner, with National Objectives being\nachieved through a mix of Politico-Diplomatic initiatives. However, the\nIndian Army will continue to undertake a 360 degree overview of the\nsecurity environment and shall be prepared to prosecute military\noperations in a multi-front scenario in all dimensions, to achieve Politico-\nMilitary objectives. We will fight as we are, at the time and place of our\nchoosing, utilising all resources, after prioritising the options based on\nour capabilities and emerge victorious, while continuing to upgrade our\ncapabilities.\nThis Doctrine provides broad tenets for the prosecution of\noperations by the Indian Army across the entire spectrum of conflict. The\nfocus will be on\nforce modernisation, resource optimisation and\ninnovative conceptual processes leading to winning strategies for future\nwars. Our geostrategic environment, external and internal threats,\npossible responses and a way ahead to develop capabilities for the\nfuture are the major determinants shaping the Land Warfare Doctrine.\nThis doctrine will lay the foundation for formulation of strategies for the\nNorthern and Western Fronts and Operational Directives.\nGeo Strategic Environment\n\nEnvironmental Realities.\n\nThe current geopolitical upheaval of shifting power centres,\nrealignment of alliances,	Security Strategy Research Institute of Japan (SSRIJ)

Unresolved border disputes, both territorial and maritime,\nillegal cross border migration, trans-national crimes\nand\nincreasing radicalisation are some of the major issues plaguing\nthe region.\n\nFuture Security Challenges.\n\nThe greatest danger to our Nation continues to be external\naggression with collusive threat from adversaries as well as\ninternal instability due to state/ non-state sponsored proxy war,\nthus imposing multi front challenges in various dimensions,\nranging from warfare in the non-contact domain, to an all out full\nspectrum war.\n\nFuture conflicts will be characterised by operating in a\nzone of ambiguity where nations are neither at peace nor at war -\na ‘Grey Zone’ which makes our task more complex. Wars will be\nHybrid in nature, a blend of conventional and unconventional,\nwith the focus increasingly shifting to multi domain Warfare\nvarying from non-contact to contact warfare.\n\nEnhancing capabilities to meet the emerging contours of\nconflict in a multi front environment mandate the Indian Army to\nbe prepared for techno-centric combat by imbibing technology,\nutilising human resources efficiently, ensuring optimal utilisation\nof\nthe defined\nbudget for force modernisation\nand further\nenhancing joint and integrated operations.\n\nWhile \nany \nfuture national \nresponse\nwould \nbe \na\ncombination of diplomacy, military and economy, the Indian Army\nmust be prepared for a swift and robust military	Security Strategy Research Institute of Japan (SSRIJ)

There is thus a need to\nprepare for the multi-faceted security challenges that lie ahead.\n\nCurrent Dynamics/ No War No Peace.\n\nA concerted effort is being made by our adversaries to\nshrink the space for conventional wars, through prosecution of\nunconventional operations at the lower end of the spectrum and\nthreats of early and irrational use of nuclear weapons at the other.\nWhile conventional war will remain central in the construct of the\nspectrum of operations,\nthe Indian Army\nwill continue to\nprosecute\neffective\nCounter Insurgency/ Counter\nTerrorism\noperations to ensure deterrence through punitive responses,\nagainst state sponsored proxy war.\n\nEnsuring territorial integrity along the Line of Control (LC),\nActual Ground Position Line (AGPL) and Line of Actual Control\n(LAC) is the prime responsibility of the Indian Army. Any\nadversarial attempt to alter the status quo along our borders will\nbe dealt with in a firm and resolute manner.\n\nLine of Actual Control.\nIn case of any deliberate\n‘transgressions’ along the Line of Actual Control, actions\nwill be taken to resolve the issue to our advantage with\nminimum \nescalation,\nin \nconsonance \nwith \nexisting\nAgreements and Protocols. However, there is a need to be\nprepared for any escalation.\n\nLine of Control.\nAlong the\nLine of Control,\noperational capacities will be further strengthened to\nmaintain moral and operational ascendency and also\nenhance our punitive response options to greater depth,\neffect, sophistication and precision.\n\nInternal Security.\nWhen\nrequisitioned\nto deal with\ninternal threats and challenges, the Indian Army will prosecute\noperations in a	Security Strategy Research Institute of Japan (SSRIJ)

Joint operations will be imperative to achieve operational\nsuccess. Integrated planning and conduct of networked theatre\nbattles will therefore be part of the Indian Army’s strategy for\nprosecuting war. A strong well-structured and demonstrated\nstrategic capability will be essential to deter war. We shall\ncontinue\nto\nenhance deterrence by development of niche\ncapabilities, strategic posturing and upgradation of infrastructure.\n\nForce Application.\nSynergised \napplication \nof \nland,\nmaritime and air components will be imperative to achieve\noperational success. All threats will be met with a calibrated\nresponse\nby seamless integration and joint application of\nresources in our arsenal across all domains of conflict.\n\nAsymmetry.\nAsymmetry with any adversary will be\noffset by better training standards, development of strategies,\nskilful\nuse of terrain\nand application of the principles of\noperational art and manoeuvre warfare. Technological asymmetry\nwith an adversary will be countered by mission oriented training,\nmotivated troops and effective leadership.\n\nConventional War.\nWhen \nforced \nto \nprosecute \na\nconventional war, it shall be to meet our National politico-military\nobjectives and be executed to ensure comprehensive military\ngains. All combat operations will be as Integrated	Security Strategy Research Institute of Japan (SSRIJ)

Appropriate simultaneous responses to hybrid and\nnon-contact warfare will be ensured in all dimensions, at all\nstages, and in all sectors of conflict.\n\nBorder Management.\nDuring conventional war,\nthe Indian Army will synergise employment of all Central\nArmed Police Forces (CAPFs) as per operational plans.\nTheir integration, training and operational procedures to\nassist in their assimilation into the war fighting effort, so as\n“For the Indian Army to remain relevant, it has to remain versatile\nand be prepared to fight across the full spectrum of conflict”.\n- Gen K Sundarji, PVSM\nNotes\n5\nto ensure smooth and seamless transition during\nconventional war is essential.\n\nNorthern Borders.\n\nAll measures will be undertaken to enhance\ndeterrence along the Northern borders. Operations\nalong our Northern borders will be force centric,\nthrough\neffective\nmulti-tiered\ndeployment,\nrapid\nmobilisation, positioning/ application of reserves,\naugmentation of forces and force multipliers.\n\nAll forces deployed along the Northern\nborders shall be self contained in all aspects and be\ncapable of fighting isolated. Reserve formations\nmust be agile to ensure rapid mobilisation and\ntimely application, augmented by forces from other\nfronts/ sectors. Strike formations shall be suitably\nmobilised, postured and acclimatised for rapid\napplication.\n\nWestern Borders.\n\nCapabilities will be\nenhanced\nto\nenable\ndeterrence along our Western borders. Operations\nalong the Western borders will be force and/ or\nspace centric with one being corollary to the other.\nOur response along the Western Front will be sharp\nand swift with the aim of destroying the centre of\ngravity of the adversary and securing spatial gains.\n\nAll forces shall be applied as Integrated\nBattle Groups, with equipment profile matched with\nenvisaged role and exploitation potential, to provide\ngreater flexibility in force application.\n\nCollusive Threat.\nIn	Security Strategy Research Institute of Japan (SSRIJ)
india_Land Warfare_doctrine_5	India	Land Warfare	event of a collusive threat,\nthe primary front will be dealt with all the resources in our\narsenal and a strong strategic defensive balance will be\nmaintained along the secondary front. The Indian Army\nshall be prepared to address collusive threats in all\nNotes\n“Solutions are found through restraint & mutual dialogue”.\n- Narendra Modi\n6\ndimensions. Military forces will be identified, rehearsed and\nequipped for such contingencies. In a given contingency,\nshould the Sub Conventional threat escalate, the Indian\nArmy will also remain prepared for punitive response\nagainst all threats in this domain with all security agencies.\n\nNon-Contact and Hybrid Warfare.\nNon-Contact and Hybrid\ndomains of conflict are now being integrated into the conventional and\nsub conventional realms and could be non-declaratory and non-\nattributable in its execution, a characteristic of Grey Zone Warfare that\nneeds to be catered for.\n\nThe Indian Army will enhance capabilities to address the\nchallenges of non-contact domains of conflict viz cyber, space\nand information as a component of our National strategy for non-\ncontact\nwarfare to cause unaffordable losses to potential\nadversaries.\n\nDue to increased threat of hybrid warfare, the Indian Army\nwill prosecute operations with designated forces, equipped and\nmandated to effect attacks/ retaliation in the Information Warfare\n(IW) domain. Adequate capabilities will be developed to dominate\nthe hybrid warfare environment, both along our Northern and\nWestern borders and in dealing with internal security, in\ncoordination with earmarked services and agencies.\n\nMilitary Operations Other Than War (MOOTW).\nThe Indian\nArmy will continue to meet its other secondary obligations like Aid to\nCivil Authorities, Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief (HADR),\nInternal Security Duties, Nation Building, UN Peace Keeping Operations\nand Out of Area Contingency (OOAC) tasks, including assistance to\nFriendly Foreign Countries (FFCs) and assistance in ‘Non	Security Strategy Research Institute of Japan (SSRIJ)
india_Land Warfare_doctrine_6	India	Land Warfare	Combatant\nEvacuation Procedures’.\n\nEnhancing Domestic Defence Capability.\nThe Indian Army\nwill integrate with defence research, public sector units and civil\nindustries to develop systems, ideas and concepts, in fielding of latest\nweapons and equipment to provide impetus to domestic defence\nproduction.\n“The weak can never forgive. Forgiveness is the attribute of the\nstrong”.\n-\nMahatma Gandhi\nNotes\n7\n\nMilitary \nDiplomacy.\nThe Indian Army will continue its\nendeavours in Military Diplomacy in the form of Military to Military\ncooperation and by utilising the services of its Defence Attachés to\nensure close coordination with other nations. Simultaneously, the Indian\nArmy would work towards balancing relations with other nations and\nform strategic partnerships to achieve our National objectives.\nCapability Development\nDevelopment of capacities will be a pragmatic mix of both\ncapability and threat based approach to enable a greater span of\nresponses to plausible scenarios for force developers to work on. We\nshall continue to\ncreate capacities that deliver national security\noutcomes through optimal utilisation of all resources and not those that\nlie idle. A balance will be maintained in development of Capacities and\nCapabilities, which must go hand in hand.\n\nDevelopment of Capacities.\n\nCapacity development will aim to enhance ‘Sector Specific\nThreat Based’ capacities and move towards a more broad\nspectrum ‘Capability Based’ force. Simultaneously, capacities to\nensure rapid infusion of technology to upgrade Intelligence,\nSurveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR), firepower, mobility and\nprecision \nweapon \ncapabilities \nand \ncreate \ntailor \nmade\norganisations with equipment/ capacities specific to sectors must\nbe enhanced. Capacities will be developed to address multiple\nchallenges of close proximity situations and enhance ability to\nfight when isolated.\n\nThis will be achieved by synergising modernisation,\noptimising, technology assimilation, developing our human\nresources	Security Strategy Research Institute of Japan (SSRIJ)
india_Land Warfare_doctrine_7	India	Land Warfare	and optimum budget utilisation. Delegation, Autonomy\nand Upgrading Operational Efficiencies shall be the prime areas\nof focus.\n\nCapabilities to be Developed.\nDevelopment of capabilities will\nbe\nbased\non a tiered, prioritised, sector specific and threat based\n“You can distil deterrence down to two factors : Capability and\nWill”.\n-\nChris Gibson\nNotes\n8\nevaluation to cater for :-\n\nHybrid Threats/ Responses Short of War/ Localised\nConflicts/ Multi Domain Capacities/ Out of Area Contingencies.\n\nFull Spectrum Deterrence and Operations.\n\nPrioritisation of acquisition shall be based upon ‘Op\nCritical’, ‘Op Essential’ and ‘Op Advantageous’ requirements. The\ntype and quantities of critical operational equipment/ assets will\nbe acquired in a balanced manner based on guaranteed funding.\n\nFocus Areas for Capability Development.\n\nOptimisation.\nThe Indian Army will continue to optimise\nits resources and forces based on the present and future\nchallenges.\n\nForce Structure.\nThe\nIndian \nArmy \nwill \nbe\nstructured to be an agile, mobile and technology driven\nforce, operating in synergy with the other Services, in\npursuance of our National Interests.\n\nHuman Resource Development (HRD).\nHuman\nResource Development will aim at preparing a soldier for\nthe future battlefield milieu. The soldier will be a scholar\nwarrior with levels of competencies commensurate to his\ntask. Digitisation and connectivity initiatives will be\nupgraded as also simulator/ distance learning/ e-learning\nprogrammes to enable optimisation of manpower. A fillip\nshall be given to Professional Military Education (PME) to\nnurture \nfuture \ncommanders \ncapable \nof \nexecuting\nknowledge based operations.\n\nSecond Echelon Capability.\nIndian Army units\nin their secondary role, as well as the Rashtriya Rifles (RR)\nand Assam Rifles (AR) battalions, deployed to conduct\nCounter Insurgency/ Counter Terrorism operations in the\nhinterland, will also be prepared, trained and suitably\nempowered, to be effectively employed for	Security Strategy Research Institute of Japan (SSRIJ)

As part of optimisation, creation of a robust\nsecond echelon capability through TA-isation and a pool of\nreservists will aim to add depth and flexibility to our force\noptimisation. These forces shall be integrated seamlessly\nas a vital component of Rear Area Security Plans.\n\nHuman – Machine Teaming.\nAt the core of our\nfuture military planning will be the effective integration of\nsoldiers, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Robotics into war-\nfighting systems that exploit\nexisting\ncapabilities\nfor\nsuccess in battle. Increase in operational effectiveness due\nto technological development in all fields will be offset by\ncorresponding optimisation.\n\nReview of Scaling.\nA holistic review of present\nscaling of holding and reserves of ammunition, equipment\nand other stocks will be carried out as per envisaged\noperational role and likely employment of each soldier/\nsub-unit/ unit/ formation at various stages of battle tailored\nto specific threats. A ‘one size fits all’ approach will be\navoided.\n\nMulti Front Capability.\nThe Indian Army will build\ncapacities to cater for a multi front threat, as the defence needs\nof the future. Employment of inter-theatre reserves with inter-\noperable equipment/ assets will ensure timely augmentation of\nforces on the primary front, while guaranteeing effective\ndeterrence on the other. This will be an important component of\nthe Theatre/ Front Strategy for enhancing strategic mobility of\nagile reserves capable of quick mobilisation in the form of\nIntegrated Battle Groups.\n\nISR and Precision Strike. Timely \nand \nassured \nISR\ninputs, in concert with intelligence of other Services/ agencies\nwill be developed to offset any terrain and force asymmetries.\nEnhancing the Information Warfare and ISR capabilities will be\ncritical for precise and decisive employment of long range\nvectors, strategic	Security Strategy Research Institute of Japan (SSRIJ)
india_Land Warfare_doctrine_9	India	Land Warfare	and other non-contact assets to cause\nmaximum degradation to the adversary.\nNotes\n“In the future, we will probably see cyber operations that change\nor manipulate electronic information to compromise its integrity\ninstead of simply deleting the access to it”.\n-\nJames R. Clapper\n10\n\nTheaterisation of Critical Assets.   Efforts will continue\ntowards Theaterisation (Inter and Intra Service) of all critical\nassets (ISR, Long Range Vectors, Aviation, Air Defence and\nLogistics) for optimum application in future conflicts. A concerted\neffort will be made to enhance the combat potential of the ground\nforces by procuring Attack Helicopters, dependent on terrain, so\nas to counter the adversary.\n\nInformation Warfare (IW).\nIndian Army will develop\ncapabilities to prosecute Information Warfare Operations over the\nentire spectrum of conflict as well as in ‘No War No Peace’\nscenario, with the aim to achieve full spectrum information\ndominance over the adversary.\n\nCyber Warfare (CW).\nCyberspace will be the new\ndimension of warfare and will be a key battle winning factor\nin future conflicts.\nWhile developing Cyber Warfare\ncapabilities, all elements/ forces must retain the capability\nto fight through a disruptive Cyber Warfare domain/\nenvironment. The Indian Army will upgrade existing Cyber\nWarfare capabilities with the objective to develop cyber\ndeterrence and defence capabilities, while simultaneously\ndevising means of eliminating such threats.\n\nElectronic Warfare (EW).   We shall continue to\ndevelop a span of Electronic Warfare eco-systems to\nupgrade operational focus, equipping and skilling. Our\nElectronic Warfare\ncapabilities shall evolve into full\nspectrum, electro-optical dominance to include capabilities\nin\nCommunication\nIntelligence (COMINT),\nElectronic\nIntelligence (ELINT), interception, jamming, spoofing and\ndeception. To contain proxy war, endeavours will continue\nto degrade the communication capabilities of terrorists/\ninsurgents and enhance our technical prowess to	Security Strategy Research Institute of Japan (SSRIJ)
india_Land Warfare_doctrine_10	India	Land Warfare	combat\nthe impact of radicalisation/ alienation.\n\nPsychological Warfare (Psy W).\nPsychological\nWarfare will be used to promote own objectives and the\nIndian Army shall graduate to a state where mass media\nbecomes an organic part of future operations. Social\nMedia, which has emerged as a powerful tool for Public\nInformation and Perception Management, will also be used\nmeaningfully and responsibly to yield desired dividends.\nNotes\n“In cyberspace, weapon system gets created in 24 hour cycles. You\nhave no earthly idea whether or not you have a defensive capability\nagainst them”.\n-\nThomas Tills\n11\n\nTechno-Centric Environment.\nThe Indian Army will\ncontinue to modernise to fight in a techno-centric combat\nenvironment which is likely to emerge in futuristic conflict\nscenarios due to revolution in key technologies like Artificial\nIntelligence, Quantum Computing, Nano\nTechnology, High-\nEnergy Lasers, Directed Energy Weapons, Hypersonic Weapons\netc so as to cater for high technology threat of Swarm Attacks\nincluding Drones, Laser and Pulsed Microwave Weapon Systems\nand Injection of False Information.\n\nSpace Warfare.\nContinuous surveillance of our borders\nby developing and employment of satellites, to provide accurate\ninputs for planning of operations, mitigation of threats and\nintegration of space based assets with ground based weapon\nplatforms will be a priority area for development. Development of\nmicro satellites, lighter and greater capacity transponders,\nmanoeuvrable and intelligent outer space satellites, with short life\nspans which can be launched ‘on demand’ basis, will be the\nessential future requirements for the Army.\n\nSpecial Forces Capability.\nSpecial Forces shall be\nequipped, structured and trained to ensure their application\nin multiple employment opportunities for exponential gains, to\nachieve our military objectives. Their equipment profiling,\nstandards of training and employment strategies must form a vital\ncomponent of our overall deterrence capability,	Security Strategy Research Institute of Japan (SSRIJ)
india_Land Warfare_doctrine_11	India	Land Warfare	both in\nunconventional/ conventional domains.\n\nForce Projection Capability.    India’s role as a regional\nsecurity provider mandates a force projection capability to further\nour national security objectives. A Rapid Reaction Force\ncomprising Integrated Battle Groups with strategic lift and\namphibious capability will be an imperative for force projection\noperations.\n\nOperational Readiness.\nA high standard of operational\nreadiness in terms of mission capable equipment, trained\npersonnel, logistics sustenance and availability of spares and\nreserves will be ensured to enable the Indian Army to prosecute\noperations at short notice and on multiple fronts.\n“You will not find it difficult to prove that battles, campaigns, and\neven wars have been won or lost primarily because of logistics”.\n-\nDwight D Eisenhower\nNotes\n12\n\nOperational Logistics.\n\nStrategic Sustenance Capacity. All modes/\nassets of transportation including strategic road/ rail\ncommunications, airfields and mounting bases will\nbe employed for enhancing capabilities for inter and\nintra theatre switching of forces and equipment.\n\nLogistics Planning.\nLogistic plans will be\ntailor-made based on the operations envisaged in\nspecific theatres. Consolidation of stocks at various\ndepots in the hinterland will be carried out as well as\nthe number of logistics echelons reviewed. In the\nTactical Battle Area (TBA), stocks will be suitably\ndispersed as per operational requirement. Logistic\nmovement will be lateral as well as linear to ensure\nflexibility and adequacy.\n\nUnified Logistics Structures.\nThe Indian\nArmy will continue to work towards formulation of\nmodernised Unified Logistics Structures under a\nsingle logistician as Commander. These structures\nshall be networked and automated for ‘Just in Time’\nsupply. This shall be in concert with our overall\nupgradation of operational logistics infrastructure\nespecially for independent/ isolated sectors.\n\nNuclear Environment.\nThe Indian Army will continue\nto enhance our	Security Strategy Research Institute of Japan (SSRIJ)
india_Land Warfare_doctrine_12	India	Land Warfare	capability to fight in a Chemical, Biological,\nRadiological and Nuclear (CBRN) environment. Field formations/\nunits will be equipped to prosecute operations through a\nChemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear contaminated\nzone, to maintain tempo of operations.\n\nTraining.\nTraining \nwill \nbe \nrealistic,\nintegrated,\noperational oriented and in sync with the Front/ Theatre threat\nassessment with the focus on imbibing technologies being\nintroduced. The focus of training will be as per Formation’s role\nwith emphasis on ‘Offensive Defence’, Inter Theatre mobilisation,\nrapid application of Strike/ Reserve Formations, innovative\nemployment \nof \nSpecial \nForces \nand \nForward \nLogistics\nManagement in a techno-centric environment.\n“Quartered in snow, silent to remain,\nWhen the bugle calls, they shall rise and march again”.\n-\nAnonymous\n(Siachen Base Camp)\nNotes\n13\n\nDeterrence.   The Indian Army shall be the primary\ninstrument of the overall deterrence capability of the Nation.\nEnhanced \noperational \npreparedness \nof \nDefensive/ \nStrike\nFormations, positioning of Sectoral/ Theatre Reserves, upgrading\ncapability of Special Forces/ Cyber Domain and demonstrated\ncapability by conduct of military exercises shall be pursued.\nConclusion\nThe Indian\nArmy\nwill\ncontinue to develop strategies\nand\ncapabilities for contingencies throughout the expanding spectrum of\nconflict aiming to dissuade, deter, delay and defend by proactive and\nresponsive engagements at the place and time of own choosing,  when\nthere is an imminent threat to National Security. In doing so, the strategy\nwill be application of all the elements of the military arsenal in\nconjunction with other instruments of Comprehensive National Power.\nThe focus of the Indian Army will be to develop cross domain\ncapabilities, facilitate enhanced jointness and integration amongst the\nthree Services and optimise forces and resources to be prepared for\neffective and robust military responses in a future battle field milieu.

Having played a mostly peripheral \npart in most of India’s past conflicts8 the Navy has also been hard pressed to define \nand justify its role. In such a context, the latest edition of the Indian Maritime \nDoctrine9 issued by the Naval Headquarters, which builds upon both an earlier \nversion released in 2004 and India’s Maritime Strategy (2007)10 provides a vital \ninsight into how the Navy draws its inspiration and conceives of its present and \nfuture mandate in a strategically dynamic era.\nThis chapter aims to provide a better understanding not only of the Indian \nMaritime Doctrine but also of the larger context surrounding it. Doctrinal \ndevelopments do not emerge from a vacuum, and are best understood from both a \ncultural and organizational perspective. It will be argued that in the Indian context, \nthe nation’s complex civil-	Iskander Rehman -  American Foreign Policy Council (AFPC)

Section one focuses on the essence of the \nmaritime doctrine itself, as well as on the complex institutional setting which \nprovides its backdrop. The document’s lofty ambitions, when juxtaposed with the \nstudy of current realities, suggest that it may be more advocatory and aspirational \nthan genuinely reflective of reality. The second section ventures that India’s naval \nthought can best be understood as syncretic, with a variety of traditions shaping \nthe service’s vision and evolution.\nFour different traditions or schools of thought are identified:\n•       \nThe Indian Continentalist School: more inward than outward-looking, and \nwhich has seldom let maritime issues seep through the mental barrier of \nthe Himalayas.\n•       \nThe Raj Pan-Oceanic School: developed at the height of the British Empire \nwhen the Indian Ocean was unified for the first time as a common strategic \nspace.\n•       \nThe Soviet School: which is more defensive in orientation, and which \nfocuses largely on the control of chokepoints and area defence.\n•       \nThe Monrovian School: through which India, in the tradition of most \nregional powers with enviable maritime positions, seeks to extend sea \ncontrol over what it perceives to be its maritime backyard.\nThe third and final section draws on these four models in order to chart out different \npotential trajectories for the Indian Navy in terms of its organization.

india_Naval_doctrine_4	India	Naval	responsibility for coastal security, bringing both \nthe State Coastal Police and Coast Guard under its wing. As a result, the 2009 \nversion attaches greater importance to ‘synergy’ and ‘intelligence-sharing’, both \nviewed as being sorely lacking when Pakistan-trained militants slipped in from \nthe Arabian Sea to leave a trail of bloody mayhem. Some of the former chapters, \nsuch as those outlining the ‘concepts of maritime power’, or ‘India’s maritime \nenvironment and interests’ have been revamped somewhat, and an entirely new \nchapter on ‘Naval Combat Power’ has been added. This chapter, however, remains \nin the same abstract and didactic mould as most of those preceding it, merely \noutlining in half a dozen pages the fact that naval combat power comprises three \nelements: conceptual, physical and human, and listing different categories of \nvessels. This educational aspect of the Indian Navy’s doctrine stands in interesting \ncontrast to those promoted by its sister services, the Indian Army and Air Force, \n11  Integrated Headquarters (Navy), Indian Maritime Doctrine, 2009, p. 3.\n12  Ibid.\n13  Integrated Headquarters (Navy), Indian Maritime Doctrine, 2009, Foreword.\n14  Ibid.\n© Copyrighted Material\n© Copyrighted Material\nwww.ashgate.com  www.ashgate.com  www.ashgate.com  www.ashgate.com  www.ashgate.com  www.ashgate.com  www.ashgate.com  www.ashgate.com  www.ashgate.com  www.ashgate.com  www.ashgate.com  www.ashgate.com \nThe Rise of the Indian Navy\n58\nwho both define their warfighting roles in detail. This difference in approach is \nclearly recognized in the opening of the doctrine, which states the following: ‘The \ndoctrine primarily addressed the military-strategic level, whilst it also covers the \noperational level. Tactical issues have been deliberately kept outside the purview \nof this doctrine, as several other naval publications comprehensively address these \naspects’.15 This self-carved doctrine, moulded from a professedly higher strategic \nlevel, and which	Iskander Rehman -  American Foreign Policy Council (AFPC)
india_Naval_doctrine_5	India	Naval	merely skims tactical issues rather than directly addressing them, \nis key to understanding what distinguishes the Navy from the other branches of the \nIndian Armed Forces. Indeed, the Navy views itself as being a multidimensional \nservice, capable of taking on many roles, of which warfighting is but one aspect.\nThis is reflected in the most absorbing section of the maritime doctrine, which \nlays out four roles for the Indian Navy: military, diplomatic, constabulary and \nbenign. These four roles echo to a certain degree those already identified more \nthan 10 years prior in the Indian Navy’s first Strategic Defence Review, which \nwere then defined as the following: sea-based deterrence, economic and energy \nsecurity, forward presence and naval diplomacy.16\nTwo important elements are worth noting, however. First, what was defined \nas naval diplomacy in 1998 has been split into two different roles – benign and \ndiplomatic – in 2009. The Indian Navy has long recognized the potential offered \nby vessels in terms of diplomacy and soft power projection. This has been reflected \nboth in words, via the earlier version of the maritime doctrine, which defined the \nNavy as an ‘effective instrument of India’s foreign policy by generating goodwill \nthrough maritime diplomacy’;17 and in actions, as over the past decade the Indian \nNavy has frequently displayed with a certain panache its desire and capacity to \nbe viewed as a provider of public goods as well as a reliable partner. Indian ships \nhave thus taken part in a wide range of humanitarian and disaster relief operations \nover the years, whether it be in the wake of the devastating 2004 tsunami, or in \n2008 after the Nargis cyclone. India has also engaged in NEOs or Non-Combatant \nEvacuation Operations, such as in 2006, when four Indian warships successfully \nevacuated more than 2,000 Indian, Sri Lankan and Nepalese citizens from a war-torn \nLebanon. Interestingly, NEOs are classified as being a form of ‘maritime mission \nand	Iskander Rehman -  American Foreign Policy Council (AFPC)

This provides an indication of the growing elasticity of the \nNavy’s perceived soft power role, where set distinctions are blurred and seem to \noverlap. Through its multiple and increasingly institutionalized naval exercises \nwith both regional and extra-regional navies, and its hosting of multilateral \ninitiatives such as the Indian Ocean Naval Symposium, the Indian Navy, as some \nUS Naval War College analysts have noted, ‘clearly sees a comparative advantage \n15  Integrated Headquarters (Navy), Indian Maritime Doctrine, 2009, p. 11.\n16  See Rahul Roy-Chaudhury, India’s Maritime Security (New Delhi: Knowledge \nWorld, 2000), pp. 125–6.\n17  Integrated Headquarters (Navy), Indian Maritime Doctrine, 2004, p. 83.\n© Copyrighted Material\n© Copyrighted Material\nwww.ashgate.com  www.ashgate.com  www.ashgate.com  www.ashgate.com  www.ashgate.com  www.ashgate.com  www.ashgate.com  www.ashgate.com  www.ashgate.com  www.ashgate.com  www.ashgate.com  www.ashgate.com \nIndia’s Aspirational Naval Doctrine\n59\nfor their service as a diplomatic instrument for New Delhi’.18 The 2009 version of \nthe maritime doctrine goes so far as to wax in lyrical terms that the mere presence \nof an Indian warship with its multi-ethnic and multi-religious crew in a foreign \nharbour will contribute to India’s image as a vibrant democracy abroad.19\nAnother interesting evolution is the sheer width of the gamut of potential \nmilitary roles laid out for the Indian Navy, which, crammed into a small box, \nappear to encompass every possible wartime function.\nThe question is whether the Indian Navy currently has the requisite ability to \naccomplish all these tasks, whether simultaneously or even sequentially.

This is \neven more the case in countries such as India, where, as it shall be shown, military \nleaders have, for various reasons, almost systematically been marginalized from \nthe decision-making process in matters of national security.\nA Complex Institutional Backdrop\nStudies of inter-war doctrinal development in Europe have pointed to the centrality \nof domestic politics. Indeed, while military doctrine is ultimately preoccupied with \nstate survival, it also provides a reflection of the allocation of power within a state. \nTherefore, in order to understand the interests that civilian and military officials \nbring to bear in the formulation of doctrine, one must also take ‘into account the \ncultural dimension of domestic politics and organizational life’.21 In India’s case, \ncivil-military relations, long marked by Nehruvian fears of creeping praetorianism, \nhave led to a highly unwieldy and cumbersome system which has had an acutely \ndeleterious effect on doctrinal and organizational development. Fearful of a drift \ntowards a militaristic state in the vein of Pakistan, India’s post-Independence \nleaders rigorously implemented a tight bureaucratic control of the young nation’s \narmed forces.22 The Raj-era post of commander-in-chief of the Indian military was \nabolished, and the service headquarters were downgraded to become ‘attached \noffices’, organizationally external to the MOD and therefore removed from major \ndecision-making. Political scientists have noted that ‘over time, concerns about \nthe distribution of military power within a state	Iskander Rehman -  American Foreign Policy Council (AFPC)
india_Naval_doctrine_9	India	Naval	become institutionalized and \nshape decision makers’ opinions about military policy’.23 In India this has led to \na dysfunctional state of affairs in which although ‘Indian power is growing each \nyear, no single agency in the country combines military, diplomatic, economic \nand intelligence capabilities into a coherent national strategy’.24 The prolonged \nabsence of a Chief of Defence Staff despite a widespread recognition of its urgent \n20  See Samuel L.

india_Naval_doctrine_10	India	Naval	politicians’,27 with more than 80 per cent of those polled for a 1997 Rand monograph \nstating that their vision of the nation’s interest frequently differed from that of the \ngovernment. In public, officers affiliated to academia or think tanks call more \ntactfully for a greater ‘cross-pollination of national security structures with military \nexpertise’, ‘which could pave the way for institutional equity’.28 In their recent \nstudy of India’s military modernization, Professors Sunil Dasgupta and Steve \nCohen observe that many of the IAS officers seconded to the Ministry of Defence \nare bereft of solid expertise, despite their overwhelming influence.29 The problem \nseems to be not so much the civil-military relationship in itself (that is, between \nthe military and elected officials) but rather the extent of technocratic ossification \nwhich has occurred over the years and which, in the view of the military, presents \na formidable ‘bureaucratic barrier preventing them from making a direct appeal to \npolitical leaders’.30 This has led to some incidents where the Navy has locked horns \nwith the Ministry of Defence and Ministry of External Affairs, most notably over \nthe 2008 decision to conduct anti-piracy operations off the coast of Somalia. Some \nhave ventured that the tension may have revolved around the MEA’s initial refusal \nto allow the Indian Navy to conduct naval interceptions.31\nCaught in such a difficult institutional setting, it is natural for the Indian Navy \nto seek to relay its interests and perceptions through indirect means, most notably \nvia the widespread diffusion of a doctrine. The desire to influence and impact \ndecision-makers, as well as the public writ large, is made clear from the very \nbeginning: ‘The Indian Maritime Doctrine is the capstone doctrinal publication of \nthe Indian Navy, which is aimed at not just the professional sea warrior, but also \n25  There is hope that this will change however, as it was recently announced that a \ntask force	Iskander Rehman -  American Foreign Policy Council (AFPC)

In \n2001 the Group of Ministers submitted their recommendations on ‘Reforming the National \nSecurity System’ and argued for the creation of a Chief of Defence Staff. For 10 years, due \nto an unsavory blend of bureaucratic and inter-service infighting, this recommendation has \nremained unimplemented.\n26  Colonel S.A.

Although the \nstrategic conceptualization of a blue-water navy has been present in India since \nIndependence, the Indian Navy has traditionally been the least favoured branch of \nthe Indian armed forces in terms of resources. This is due in part, as we shall see, to \nIndia’s long-standing continentalist tradition, but also to more prosaic immediate \npost-Independence	Iskander Rehman -  American Foreign Policy Council (AFPC)
india_Naval_doctrine_12	India	Naval	concerns.\nIndeed, after a series of brutal frontier conflicts in which navies played at best \na secondary role, India’s main priorities were to strengthen its land borders and \nbuild up its Army and Air Force, which were the primary actors in the event of a \nconflict with China or Pakistan. The Indian Navy, no longer considered as relevant, \nwas relegated to the backseat, its share in the defence budget even plummeting at \none stage to a dismal 3 per cent. Under the tenures of Indira and Rajiv Gandhi, \nthe Navy spasmodically regained impetus, but it has only really been over the \npast 15 years that India’s political leadership has actively endorsed an ambitious \nblue-water role. Nevertheless, to this day the Navy’s share of the defence budget \nremains considerably lower than that of the Army or the Air Force, and even \nthe most optimistic predictions for its future allocation doubt it will climb much \nabove 20 per cent in years to come.33 Former Naval Officers’ frustration with \ntheir service’s continued ‘Cinderella status’ and over what they perceive to be a \nponderous, strategically myopic Army is occasionally made manifest,34 as is the \nlong-standing tension between the Navy and Air Force over the sensitive issue of \nnaval aviation.35 Both in its doctrine and Maritime Military Strategy document, the \nIndian Navy appears intent on overcoming these inter-service squabbles and ‘trying \nto carve out a role for itself in support of joint operations-particularly support \n32  Integrated Headquarters (Navy), Indian Maritime Doctrine, 2009, p. 1.\n33  The Navy only captured 15 per cent of the defence budget in 2010–11.\n34  For instance, in a recent article for the Woodrow Wilson Center in Washington \nDC, former Chief of Naval Staff Arun Prakash writes the following: ‘The Indian Army \nhas been driven into an intellectual and doctrinal cul-de-sac by 20 years of insurgency \nwhich demands an ever-increasing number of boots on the ground’.

Experts have pointed out that if the Indian Navy were \nto maintain a flotilla of four to five missile-armed submarines on constant patrol, \nthis would engulf much, if not all of its present budget.46 It remains unclear, as \nof now, whether the financial burden of India’s nascent underwater deterrent will \nbe shouldered by the Navy or by specific government-funded allocations. If this \nfinancial millstone is tied around the Indian Navy’s neck, it will require a far larger \nslice of the defence cake. If not, it appears impossible for it to be able to both \nremain a carrier-centric force and simultaneously pursue its nuclear ambitions. \nSome difficult trade-offs and cornelian choices will need to be made, and it is \nrevealing that when the official announcement of the construction of a second \nATV was made, there was reportedly some grumbling amongst the more carrier-\nfocused officers of the IN, who expressed their desire to see ‘the focus … also shift \nto the surface vessels that need to be part of the flotilla that normally accompanies \nthe Air Defence Ship47(India’s first indigenous aircraft carrier, currently under \nconstruction)’.\nIt is also unclear when the submarines will be truly operational. The INS \nArihant, which was launched with great fanfare in 2009, had been described at first \nas a ‘technology demonstrator’ rather than as a combat vessel. Recently however, \nstatements from the Naval Chief of Staff have indicated that the INS Arihant \nwill be deployed on deterrent patrols as soon as it is commissioned in 2012.48 \nFurthermore, information surrounding the precise armament system of the ATVs is \nshrouded in opacity. The vessels, which were constructed with extensive Russian \nassistance, seem to be lighter versions of the Soviet Charlie class submarine, a \nmodel of which the Indian Navy operated on lease for three years from 1988 to \n1991.

While cruising	Iskander Rehman -  American Foreign Policy Council (AFPC)

The induction of a submarine-\ncentred nuclear deterrent will therefore need to be accompanied by a revamped \nsystem of command and control which, while leaving critical second-strike \ndecisions in the hands of elected officials, would also entrust a far greater degree \nof operational responsibility to the Indian Navy than ever before.\n•       \nGreater Resources by stressing the need for a large blue-water fleet capable \nof accomplishing the exceptionally wide range of war and peacetime roles \nlaid out.\nThe tasks set out for the Navy in the Maritime Doctrine are multiple and wide-\nranging, whether it be in peacetime or in war.

A 3,500 km range SLBM, the K-4, is reportedly under development, but is unlikely \nto be fielded before 2018.\n50  Contact with deep-cruising submarines can be maintained through the use of \nextremely low frequencies (ELF) whose signals penetrate the ocean’s deeper layers and \nare immune to the atmospheric disturbances caused by nuclear detonations, and through \nlaser communication. Open sources suggest that India has invested in ELF and studied \nlaser communications since the 1980s (there is reportedly a VLF or very low frequency \nbroadcasting station at Vijayanarayanam in Tamil Nadu which can broadcast several metres \nbelow seawater) but it is unclear whether an effective communications system for great \ndepths is yet operational.

A Carrier task force \nis presented as being a versatile force-multiplier: ‘a self contained and composite \nbalanced force, capable of undertaking the entire range of operational tasks’.52 \nYet India currently only floats one ageing carrier, which is rasping its last after \nseveral refits, in the hope that its successor, the Vikramaditya, will not fall prey to \nfurther delays. Walter Ladwig’s detailed assessment in a previous chapter of the \nforce structure and procurement patterns of the Indian Navy reveals that the Indian \nNavy is modernizing, but not growing. Indeed, while India’s fleet now boasts more \nadvanced platforms than at the end of the 1990s, it has in fact stagnated in purely \nnumerical terms, contracting from 51 capital ships in 1991 to 50 today.53 The \ngradual withering of its submarine fleet, in particular, is cause for concern, as is the \nNavy’s relative paucity in terms of anti-submarine warfare capability. This puts \ninto question the Indian Navy’s ability to enact a credible strategy of sea denial \ngeared towards an extra-regional power such as China and suggests that the fleet \nmay be becoming increasingly unbalanced in	Iskander Rehman -  American Foreign Policy Council (AFPC)

And yet, as retired naval officer Ashok \nSawhney recently highlighted, the Navy’s capital budget, that is, the portion of the \nbudget devoted to funding new acquisitions, amounted in 2009 to 2.5 billion dollars \nout of a total of 4 billion.54 This amount, notes Sawhney, remains very modest \nwhen compared with some of the other naval budgets in Asia such as China, Japan \nor South Korea, pegged respectively at 32,55 11.6 and 4.2 billion dollars. Although \nthe Navy’s overall budget will continue to expand in nominal terms due to the \noverall increase in the defence budget enabled by India’s sustained GDP growth, \nit will be hard pressed to fulfil the terms set out in its own doctrine if it does not \nreceive a more generous allocation. The issue of budgetary shortfalls becomes \neven more stark if one considers, as mentioned previously, the prohibitive costs \nassociated with developing and sustaining a viable sea-based nuclear deterrent.\n51  ‘Sea control is the central concept around which the IN is structured, and aircraft \ncarriers are decidedly the most substantial contributors to it’, Integrated Headquarters, \nMinistry of Defence (Navy), Indian Maritime Doctrine, 2009, p. 125.\n52  Ibid., p. 125.\n53  See Walter C.

In \nthe past, writers and theorists have attempted to gain a sense of India’s naval \nthinking by applying Western concepts, invoking the more sea-drenched chapters \nof the nation’s past, or by applying binary divisions of Indian naval officers into \ndifferent schools of thought. It will be suggested here, that, as always when it \ncomes to India, its thinking on naval matters can best be understood as variegated \nand syncretic. Different traditions and schools of thought have been absorbed and \nstudied, rejected or re-crafted, and none can be put forward as the overriding or \ndefinitive model for fully apprehending such a complex maritime outlook. This \nsection proceeds to outline four tentative traditions or schools which can serve \nas useful stepping stones in the understanding of the syncretic naval thought \nundergirding the maritime doctrine: the Continentalist tradition, the Raj-era pan-\noceanic vision,	Iskander Rehman -  American Foreign Policy Council (AFPC)

Until the advent of the Raj, the subcontinent \nwas never completely unified as a common strategic space.

To this enduring north/south divide must be added the	Iskander Rehman -  American Foreign Policy Council (AFPC)
india_Naval_doctrine_24	India	Naval	divisions within \nearlier Indian polities themselves, whose foremost security concerns revolved \naround domestic, rather than foreign affairs. The Laws of Manu, which can be \ndated to the second century BC reflect the primacy of domestic concerns, advising \nthe king, after settling his country ‘to constantly make the utmost effort to clear out \nthe thorns’.58 Similarly, the Arthashastra, viewed by many as the seminal Indian \ntext on statecraft, devotes equal, if not more attention to internal secessionist or \nclandestine activities as it does to external threats.59 William J. Brenner ventures \nthat in addition to the system of concentric circles, or ‘mandala’ which is famously \napplied in the Arthashastra to distinguish between allied and rival states by virtue \nof spatial adjacency, one can also detect a ‘circle of anomie’ between the civilized \nresidents of the plains, and the unbending nomadic inhabitants of the forests.60 \nRomila Thapar, a renowned Indian historian, notes that the Arthashastra advises the \nking not to trust forest-chiefs and that ‘from the mid first millennium AD onwards \nthere were references to the uprooting of forest-dwellers, or to their conquest \nand assimilation becoming necessary to the foundation of new kingdoms’.61 \nThe forest was to early Indian polities what the steppe was to Imperial China – \na wild ungoverned territory, whose inhabitants lived on the fringes of civilized \nsociety, and who were to be shunned in times of weakness, or cleansed in times of \nstrength. In both cases, topography ‘played a role in fostering and perhaps shaping \nopposition to imperial unity’.62 This struggle for internal consolidation, one could \nargue, persists to this day, whether it be via the numerous insurgencies that India \nhas experienced throughout its post-Independence history, or, more strikingly, \nin the jungle-swathed stretches of the Naxalite belt where tribal, impoverished \ninhabitants wage a slow, grinding conflict against the Federal State	Iskander Rehman -  American Foreign Policy Council (AFPC)

After Independence, a series of short, \nbrutal territorial conflicts with India’s two largest trans-Himalayan neighbours \nonly served to sustain Delhi’s northern fixation. The continued preponderance of \nthe Army, which dwarfs its sister services in both size and resources must thus be \nviewed in this light.\nAndrew C. Winner notes that in the absence of an official Indian National \nSecurity Strategy, the closest India has to ‘a publicly articulated strategy’ are the \nannual reports of the Ministry of Defence, and that maritime issues	Iskander Rehman -  American Foreign Policy Council (AFPC)
india_Naval_doctrine_26	India	Naval	are barely \nmentioned. He then notes that the contrast between the centrality of the Indian \nOcean in the Indian Navy’s statements and ‘its relative absence in those of other \nofficial Indian pronouncements’ serves as a powerful reminder of the continued \nprevalence of land-centric views in Delhi,63 where, some add, ‘the service (the navy) \nlacks real political influence’.64 The Indian maritime doctrine displays an awareness \nof the challenges that reside in attempting to unfetter India’s strategic thinking from \nits continental shackles-most notably in its opening section ‘Maritime Doctrine in \nPerspective’ which attempts to unmoor India from its continental tethers by crafting \na viable historical maritime narrative. Nevertheless, it remains highly uncertain \nwhether the Navy will prove to as persuasive as the 2009 doctrine would suggest.\nThe Raj’s Pan-Oceanic Vision\nAt the height of the Raj, a unified British India sat squarely in the midst of a \npacified Indian Ocean, where its influence stretched from rim to rim. After the \nFrench Admiral De Suffren left the bay of Bengal in 1783, the Indian Ocean was \nunified for the first time in history as a common strategic space: a British lake, \nwhere no foreign power could afford to stage a sizeable military presence without \nattracting the immediate attention of the Royal Navy, whose attitude in the Indian \nOcean was both proprietorial and assertive. In 1905, when the Russian Admiral \nRozhestvensky steamed his ramshackle fleet of antiquated ships from Kronstadt \naround the Cape of Good Hope and towards the East China Sea where it was to \nbe eventually sunk by the Japanese, he was contemptuously shadowed by British \n63  Andrew C.

This could \nrange from punitive ‘butcher and bolt’ expeditions such as the one launched in \n1867 against an unruly Abyssinian emperor, and which comprised more than \n13,000 British and Indian soldiers accompanied by 26,000 camp followers,66 to \nmass-shipments of Indian troops to fight in both worlds wars, where they served \neverywhere from the dry deserts of the Sahara to the mud-caked fields of Flanders. \nShips were dispatched from Bombay and Madras to patrol the Persian Gulf and \nprotect sea lanes from rapacious Arab slavers and pirates. The two-centuries-old \npeace dividend in the Indian Ocean came to a brutal, shuddering halt in 1942 when \nSingapore, the great bastion of the east, fell to the Japanese. As the emperor’s \ntroops blitzkrieged their way through Malaya, and the first bombs started to rain \ndown on Calcutta, the moral and physical collapse of Britain’s Eastern Empire \n‘seemed an event so extraordinary and unprecedented that panic spread through \nthe civilian population (in India) across thousands of miles’.67 With the intrusion \nof Japanese ships into the Indian Ocean, the Raj’s pan-oceanic vision had come \nto an end.\nRecently, however, certain Indian strategists have been calling for a revival \nof Raj-era pan-oceanism. Chief amongst the revivalists is C. Raja Mohan who, in \nthe vein of the famed Indian historian K.M.

This focus on power projection \nis equally evident in the 2009 maritime doctrine, which outlines what appears to \nbe a Raj-like pan-oceanic vision with primary and secondary areas of maritime \ninterest.

As Harvard historian Sugata \nBose wisely cautions, ‘One has to be careful about switching too easily between \nthe past and present tenses of Empire’.73 India’s geopolitical circumstances in this \ncentury are wildly different from those of the Raj in its heyday. Segmented and \ntruncated, India no longer has the subcontinental unity which enabled the Raj to \nproject such power into Central Asia, the Persian Gulf and beyond. A revisionist \nand resurgent China breathes heavily at India’s door, and Delhi can no longer \nshelter behind a ‘Finlandized’ Tibet in order to keep it at bay. The vast imperial \nmilitary machine which rolled out from the peninsula at the time of the Raj came \nat a prohibitive cost, and alienated its Indian subjects who toiled and wilted under \ncolonial rule. It has been estimated, for instance, that Army expenditure accounted \nfor 41.9 per cent of the Indian Government budget in 1881–82 and rose to 51.9 per \ncent by 1904–1905.74 With a defence budget that has rarely risen above 3 per cent \nof GDP, modern-day India seems ill placed to revive such a militaristic legacy. \nShifting geopolitical circumstances, however, such as a pacified subcontinent, may \nencourage India to look further afield and develop its expeditionary capabilities. \nArmy officer Harinder Singh, for instance, predicts that ‘in the forseeable future \nthe Indian Army	Iskander Rehman -  American Foreign Policy Council (AFPC)

Barnett \ndivided the Indian Navy into two broad strategic factions, which he dubbed the \nBritish school and the Soviet school.77 Whereas the officers in the so-called ‘British \nschool’ were focused on international coalition-building and the protection of sea \nlines of communication, the members of the Soviet school were more intent on \nenforcing a strategy based on deterrence and sea denial. Barnett even introduced a \ngeographical distinction between the Eastern Fleet based at Visakhpatnam, which \nhe claims was long considered the	Iskander Rehman -  American Foreign Policy Council (AFPC)

It is no secret that throughout much of the Cold \nWar, the Indian armed forces shared close strategic ties with the Soviet Union \n– but to what extent, if any, can Soviet naval thinking be discerned in India’s \ndoctrinal development?\nThe Indian Navy’s rapprochement with the Soviet Union only occurred at the \nbeginning of the 1960s, before which the Indian Navy’s principal mentor was the \nRoyal Navy, where most of the young nation’s senior officers had been trained. The \nfirst four Commanders-in-Chief of the Indian Navy were Royal Navy officers, as \nwere the fleet commanders, and every year the fleet would take part in multilateral \nexercises off the former British naval base of Trincomalee, in Sri Lanka, with \nthe British Navy and other Commonwealth countries. As the Cold War unfolded, \nhowever, and bipolarity rigidified, the Indian Navy’s partnership with it former \ncolonial overseer began to slowly crumble. In 1964, an Indian request for help \nfrom London in establishing a submarine arm was rejected, and the Indian Navy \nturned to an eager Soviet Union for assistance, receiving its first batch of vessels \nin 1965.78 From then on, and until the end of the Cold War, the Soviet Union was \nto remain a privileged partner, assisting the Indian Navy in the construction of a \nmajor naval dockyard along its eastern seaboard at Visakhpatnam, and leasing \nNew Delhi a Charlie Class SSN. Both navies, while not engaging in formal joint \nmilitary exercises, reportedly occasionally coordinated their ASW capabilities to \nmonitor American submarine patrols in the Arabian Sea.79 Indo-Russian naval \ninteraction focused largely on the hybridization of Russian weapon systems and \n76  Walter C.

Despite the fact that many of the current acting \nsenior naval officers received some training in the Soviet Union, people such as \nthe retired Admiral J.G. Nadkarni profess that ‘the Soviets were generous with \ntheir equipment but not with their knowledge – they passed on no tactical know-\nhow or doctrine.81’ Indian Naval personnel were frequently disconcerted by \ntheir Soviet partners’ obsessive ‘secretiveness’, rigid ideological indoctrination \nand strict system of vertical specialization.82 The interflow of ideas was further \nstemmed by the presence of an enduring language barrier between both navies: \nfew Soviet commanders could speak fluent English, the working tongue of their \nSouth Asian counterparts. Another Indian officer, when recently interviewed, \nargued that the 1971 missile attack on Karachi, when India surprised Pakistan \n(and allegedly the Soviet Union) by towing Osa class missile boats best suited for \ncoastal defence across the Arabian Sea, is a prime example of how ‘India would \ntake Soviet equipment but then use it creatively in its own way’.83\nAt first glance,	Iskander Rehman -  American Foreign Policy Council (AFPC)

Nevertheless, if one is to \napply the logic of Barnett, there are may be certain parallels that can be drawn, \nmost notably between the intense focus on SLOC and chokepoints in the Indian \nMaritime Doctrine, and the Soviet concept of ‘area defence’. Area defence was a \nsomewhat malleable concept which revolved primarily around the rapid seizing of \nlocal sea control around key chokepoints in order to better secure the safety of the \nSoviet Union’s home waters and SSBN bastions while preventing enemy carrier \ntask forces from getting into strike range of Russian shores.84 Area defence, while \nbeing tactically offensive, was strategically defensive in nature, centring on the use \nof key chokepoints to establish naval chains which would lock out conventionally \nsuperior forces from the USSR’s ‘inner defence perimeter’. In both versions of \nIndia’s Maritime Doctrine, heavy emphasis is laid on the control of chokepoints \nand SLOC interdiction, the 2004 edition noting that the ‘control of choke points \ncould be useful as a bargaining chip in the international power game where the \n80  For a comprehensive account of the Indian Navy’s Russian acquisition patterns \nduring the second half of the Cold War see Vice Admiral G.M.

Professor James R.

The oft-cited example is Nehru’s speech in 1961, prior to the eviction of \nthe Portuguese from Goa, during which he said the following:\nEven some time after the United States had established itself as a strong power, \nthere was fear of interference by European powers in the American continents, \nand this led to the famous declaration by President Monroe of the United \nSates that any interference by European powers in the American continents \nwould be an interference with the American political system.

india_Naval_doctrine_38	India	Naval	codification under the Monroe \nDoctrine enables India to utilize ready-made concepts and instantly recognizable \nvocabulary in the crafting of its maritime vision. This is reflected in official naval \npublications, with then Chief of Naval Staff Sureesh Mehta drawing on the concept \nof maritime ‘manifest destiny’91 in the foreword to the Maritime Military Strategy. \nThe latest edition of the Indian Maritime Doctrine also seems to unravel, as was \nnoted previously, a certain geographical logic to India’s primacy in the region.\nWhat would distinguish the Monrovian school, however, from the Raj pan-\noceanic school? In both cases India asserts its desire to extend its control over the \nIndian Ocean, but whereas the Raj pan-oceanic school envisions an Indian Ocean \nunified as a common strategic space, whole and at peace, the Monrovian school’s \noverriding concern is to keep potentially threatening external forces out. The Raj \npan-oceanic vision is that of a future overwhelmingly self-confident power in the \nIndian Ocean, whose primacy is uncontested. The Monrovian school, on the other \nhand, envisions a navy geared towards the possibility of an external threat. The \n2009 maritime doctrine operates a useful distinction between ‘sea control’, the \ncore concept around which the Indian Navy is said to revolve, and ‘command \nof the sea’. Command of the sea, the doctrine points out, is ‘unqualified by time \nand space’, and is ‘rarely, if ever, achievable’.92 Control of the sea, on the other \nhand, ‘provides no guarantee of protection from outside attack’.93 From this one \ncan posit that the Raj pan-oceanic vision is one which chases after a hypothetical \n‘command of the sea’, whereas the Monrovian school, more pragmatic and threat-\nbased, seeks merely ‘control of the sea’.\nDoctrinal Evolutions and Organizational Trajectories\nIndia’s Maritime Doctrine is the result of a highly syncretic fusion of different \nschools of thought, historical perceptions, and ways of viewing the	Iskander Rehman -  American Foreign Policy Council (AFPC)

Didactic in tone, advocatory in intent, the document is also highly \naspirational, charting out roles and missions for the Navy it would like to be, \nrather than for the force it currently is. The naval thinking at the heart of its vision \nis a fascinating fusion of different concepts and traditions, which gives credence \nto the notion that India’s true strength lies in its innate syncretism. Strategically \nminded and outward-looking, the Indian Navy could add a much-needed direction \nto India’s slow drift towards great power status. But in order for it to do so, both \nIndia’s elephantine bureaucracy and wary political leadership will need to cast off \nthe outdated perceptions which needlessly tether India to the shore. The nation’s \nlargely khaki-clad military will also need to undergo a profound transformation, \nwhich helps give birth to a more harmonious civil-military relationship, while \nproducing a rebalancing in favour of a more powerful navy. India’s rise in wealth, \npower and influence is manifest. The path to greatness, however, does not lie in \nthe dusty plains and frozen passes of its northern reaches.

Since the 1979 revolution, Iranian military \ndoctrine has continued to evolve and adapt with the regime’s shifting threat \nperceptions and regional political developments.  \n  \nIran’s armed forces have tailored their war-fighting strategies to counter \ntechnologically superior adversaries, such as the United States. Tacitly \nacknowledging it has little chance of winning a conventional force-on-force \nconflict, Iran has opted for deterrence-based model of attrition warfare that raises \nan opponent's risks and costs, rather than reducing its own. The goal is to inflict \na psychological defeat that inhibits an enemy’s willingness to fight. \n \nAsymmetric warfare plays a central role in Iranian military theory. Iran’s \narmed forces appear to be focusing on the development of niche capabilities that \nplay to Iranian strengths—manpower,	Michael Connell - The Iran Primer

Most senior officers are veterans of the \n“imposed war,” which has had a major influence on Iranian strategic thinking. \nConcepts such as self-reliance, “holy defense,” and export of the revolution first \nentered the military lexicon during the Iran-Iraq War and were codified as \ndoctrine in the early 1990s. These ideas mingled with concepts from pre-\nrevolutionary doctrine, which was heavily influenced by the United States, to \nform a unique hybrid that distinguished modern Iranian military doctrine from \nits largely Soviet-inspired counterparts in the Arab world. \n  \nAfter the war, Tehran gradually scaled back its efforts to export its \nrevolution. As its foreign policy goals shifted, Iran’s national security strategy \nalso became more defensive. Iranian military strategists began to pay more \nattention to the principles of modern maneuver warfare, such as combined and \njoint operations. In the mid-1990s, there was even talk about merging the IRGC \nwith the regular military, the Artesh, to alleviate the command and control-\nrelated problems of having two parallel military services operating in tandem. \nIran’s military capabilities still lagged behind its doctrine, but by the end of the \ndecade, its forces were gradually evolving into professional, Western-style \nmilitaries.  \n \nThe 9/11 attacks and U.S. invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan led Tehran to \nreconsider the trajectory of its armed forces. The regional security environment \nhad changed drastically. Ba’athist Iraq and Taliban Afghanistan—two of Iran’s \nmain rivals—were no longer a threat. But the United States suddenly had troops	Michael Connell - The Iran Primer
iran__doctrine_2	Iran		positioned along both its western and eastern flanks. This confluence of events, \ncoupled with rumblings in Washington about opportunities for regime change, \nled Tehran to reassess its national security strategy. Iran’s armed forces began to \ntailor their strategies specifically to counter the perceived U.S. threat. \n \nLand warfare doctrine \n \nIn 2005, the IRGC announced that it was incorporating a flexible, layered \ndefense —referred to as a mosaic defense—into its doctrine. The lead author of \nthis plan was General Mohammad Jafari, then director of the IRGC’s Center for \nStrategy, who was later appointed commander of the IRGC. \n \nAs part of the mosaic defense, the IRGC has restructured its command \nand control architecture into a system of 31 separate commands—one for the city \nof Tehran and 30 for each of Iran’s provinces. The primary goal of restructuring \nhas been to strengthen unit cohesion at the local level and give commanders \nmore latitude to respond to potential threats—both foreign and domestic. But the \nnew structure would also make it difficult for hostile forces to degrade Iranian \ncommand and control, a lesson the Iranian military has learned by analyzing U.S. \noperations in Iraq, Afghanistan and the Balkans. \n \nThe mosaic defense plan allows Iran to take advantage of its strategic \ndepth and formidable geography to mount an insurgency against invading \nforces. Most of Iran’s population centers and major lines of communication are \nspread out within the interior of the country. Iran’s borders are ringed by rugged \nmountain ranges that serve as natural barriers to invasion. As enemy supply \nlines stretched into Iran’s interior, they would be vulnerable to interdiction by \nspecial stay-behind cells, which the IRGC has formed to harass enemy rear \noperations.   \n \nThe Artesh, a mix of armored, infantry and mechanized units, would \nconstitute Iran’s initial line of defense against invading forces. IRGC troops \nwould support this effort, but they would	Michael Connell - The Iran Primer
iran__doctrine_3	Iran		also form the core of popular \nresistance, the bulk of which would be supplied by the Basij, the IRGC’s \nparamilitary volunteer force. The IRGC has developed a wartime mobilization \nplan for the Basij, called the Mo’in Plan, according to which Basij personnel \nwould augment regular IRGC units in an invasion scenario. \n \nIRGC and Basij exercises have featured simulated ambushes on enemy \narmored columns and helicopters. Much of this training has been conducted in \nan urban environment, suggesting that Iran intends to lure enemy forces into \ncities where they would be deprived of mobility and close air support. Iran has \nemphasized passive defense measures—techniques used to enhance the \nbattlefield survivability —including camouflage, concealment and deception. \n \nNaval doctrine \n \nTehran views maritime combat operations much the same way as it views \nland-based operations. Iranian naval doctrine is geared toward confronting a \ntechnologically superior adversary—often assumed to be the U.S. Navy—with a \nform of guerrilla warfare at sea. The bases of this doctrine were developed \nduring the Tanker War (1984-1988), during which Iran used aircraft, speedboats, \nsea mines and land-based anti-ship cruise missiles to attack civilian tanker \nshipping in the Persian Gulf. After a U.S. frigate, the Samuel B. Roberts, was badly \ndamaged by an Iranian mine, the U.S. Navy retaliated with Operation Praying \nMantis (1988), destroying two Iranian oil platforms and sinking several Iranian \nsurface vessels, including a corvette, a guided missile patrol craft and smaller \ngunboats.  \n  \nAfter Operation Praying Mantis, Iran apparently determined that its \nmaritime forces would not be as effective in a conventional force-on-force naval \nconflict with adversaries such as the United States. Incorporating lessons learned \nfrom the Tanker War, the IRGC Navy (IRGCN) and, to a lesser degree, the \nregular Navy (IRIN) developed an asymmetric strategy based on avoiding direct \nor sustained	Michael Connell - The Iran Primer
iran__doctrine_4	Iran		confrontations at sea. It instead relies on surprise attacks, ambushes \nand hit-and-run operations. Rather than inflict a decisive defeat, Iran’s maritime \nforces would seek to inflict enough causalities to raise the cost of victory to an \nunpalatable level. \n \nIran’s naval doctrine relies on a layered defense and massing of firepower, \nintegrating multiple sea, land and air-based weapons simultaneously to \noverwhelm and confuse adversaries. As Iran’s naval doctrine has matured, the \nIranians have acquired a large inventory of naval materiel suitable for \nasymmetric warfare. This includes naval mines, which can be covertly deployed \nusing small boats or commercial vessels; land and sea-based anti-ship cruise \nmissiles; small fast-attack craft, which can engage in swarming operations or \nsuicide attacks; and submarines, including three Russian-supplied KILO-class \ndiesel-electric submarines and numerous North Korean and domestically \nproduced midget submarines, which can be used in the Gulf’s shallow areas.  \n \nGeography is a key element in Iranian naval planning. The Gulf’s \nconfined space, which is less than 100 nautical miles wide in many places, limits \nthe maneuverability of large surface assets, such as aircraft carriers. But it plays \nto the strengths of Iran’s naval forces, especially the IRGCN. The Gulf’s northern \ncoast is dotted with rocky coves ideally suited for terrain masking and small boat \noperations. The Iranians have also fortified numerous islands in the Gulf that sit \nastride major shipping lanes. \n \nIran has developed a strategy to deny hostile navies access to the Persian \nGulf that focuses on the strategically sensitive Strait of Hormuz. This strategic \nmaritime chokepoint is only 29 nautical miles wide at its narrowest point. Iranian \nofficials have hinted that they might close the strait during a conflict, thereby \ntemporarily cutting off as much as 30 percent of the world’s oil supply. But \nclosing the strait would also cause tremendous	Michael Connell - The Iran Primer
iran__doctrine_5	Iran		economic damage for the \nIranians, so they are not likely to undertake such a measure lightly. Given the \nstrait’s importance, however, disrupting maritime traffic in it or even threatening \nto do so would be an effective tool for Iran to pressure neighbors and intimidate \nfoes. \n  \nAir and air defense doctrine \nIranian air and air defense doctrine is focused on defending Iranian \nairspace and deterring aggression, although certain Iranian aircraft, such as the \nSu-24 fighter-bomber, can be used in an offensive capacity. Surface-to-air missiles \n(SAMs) and interceptor aircraft—most of which belong to the regular Islamic \nRepublic of Iran Air Force (IRIAF)—both play an important role in this effort. \nIran’s pilots are among the best trained in the region. They continue to use U.S. \ntraining manuals and employ U.S. tactics—a legacy of U.S.-Iranian military \nexchanges during the shah’s rule.  \n \nThe IRIAF and the Air Defense Force, a separate command within the \nArtesh, face numerous challenges in defending Iranian air space. In this case, \ngeography is a limiting factor, given the size of Iran and its mountainous terrain, \nwhich tend to produce gaps in radar coverage. For the IRIAF, aging and \noutdated equipment remains another problem. Many aircraft in the IRIAF’s \ninventory, including mainstays such as the F-14A and the F-4D, were supplied \nby the United States before the 1979 revolution. Some of these platforms have \nbeen kept running, either by cannibalizing parts from other aircraft or procuring \nspare parts on the black market, but IRIAF readiness levels are assumed to be \nlow due to maintenance issues. \n \nIran has managed to acquire several batteries of the advanced Tor-M1 \nmedium altitude SAM system from the Russians, but its air defense capabilities \nremain limited. As of mid-2010, efforts to buy the advanced long-range SA-300 \nSAM from the Russians had failed. Iran also lacks an integrated air defense \nnetwork or the ability to engage air-to-air targets	Michael Connell - The Iran Primer
iran__doctrine_6	Iran		beyond visual range. \n  \nAs a result of these challenges, Iran’s military has opted to use its limited \nair and air defense assets to protect high-value point targets, including Tehran \nand the country’s nuclear facilities. Iranian pilots have been trained to \ncompensate for the limitations of their aircraft, avionics and weapons systems by \nusing advanced tactics, such as terrain masking, to ambush enemy aircraft \nwithout being detected. Iran’s air and air defense forces have also attempted to \naugment the survivability of their units with passive defense measures, \nincluding asset dispersion and the use of forward operating bases, hardened \nshelters and hidden installations. \n \nBallistic missile doctrine \n \nIran’s ballistic missile program dates back to the middle of the 1980s, \nduring the Iran-Iraq War. For Tehran, Iraq’s use of ballistic missiles against \nIranian strategic targets highlighted a critical vulnerability in Iran’s defenses; it \nalso demoralized Iran’s civilian population. To deter Iraq from attacking its \npopulation centers and strategic industries, Iran initiated its own ballistic missile \nprogram, beginning with the initial shipment of a limited number of SCUD-B \nmissiles from Libya. By the end of the war, Iran had launched over 100 ballistic \nmissiles at Iraqi targets in what would become known as the “War of the Cities.”  \n \nIran’s strategic missile forces are now key to its deterrence strategy, in part \nbecause they are implicitly linked to Iran’s weapons of mass destruction \nprograms. In 2010, Iran had the largest inventory of ballistic missiles in the \nMiddle East. The IRGC, which has operational control over Iran’s missile forces, \ncontinues to extend the range and improve the performance of its ballistic \nmissiles, several classes of which can range Israel and the Gulf countries. Their \nlimited accuracy suggests they would not be useful in a conventional counter-\nforce role. Instead, they are probably intended for strategic targets such as	Michael Connell - The Iran Primer

Iran is therefore unlikely to seek a direct, \nforce-on-force confrontation with the United States.  \n \n However, there is ample room for miscommunication between Iranian \nand U.S. forces at the tactical and operational levels. The recent push to \ndecentralize command and control within the IRGC could have \nunintended consequences in terms of escalation, especially in the Persian \nGulf. \n \n For the foreseeable future, lack of coordination between the IRGC and the \nArtesh is likely to remain a key weak point in terms of Iranian military \nplanning, due to underlying structural issues and institutional rivalries. \n \nMichael Connell is director of Iranian Studies at the Center for Naval Analyses, a non-\nprofit institution that conducts research and analysis in Washington D.C.

We should not\nattempt to always designate one thing or another as a critical vulner-\nability. A critical vulnerability frequently is transitory or time-sensi-\ntive. Some things, such as the political will to resist, may always be\ncritical, but will be vulnerable only infrequently. Other things, such\nas capital cities or an opponents fleet, may often be vulnerable, but\nare not always critical. What is critical will depend on the situation.\nWhat is vulnerable may change from one hour to the next.\nSomething may be both critical and vulnerable for a brief time only.\nThe commanders challenge is to identify quickly enemy strengths\nand weaknesses, and recognize critical vulnerabilities when they ap-\npear. He must rapidly devise plans to avoid the strengths, exploit\nthe weaknesses, and direct the focus of effort toward attacking the\ncritical vulnerabilities so that he can ultimately collapse the enemys\ncenter of gravity.\nFocus of Effort and Main Effort\nThe focus of effort is the paramount objective to be accom-\nplished by the force and is therefore always on the critical vulnerabil-\nity that will expose the enemys center of gravity. Since we concentrate\nall our resources and energy on that objective, designating the focus\nof effort is an important decision requiring the acceptance of risk.\nResponsibility for attaining the focus of effort lies with the main\neffort. A commander unifies the force toward the focus of effort by\nassigning one unit or group as the main effort.\n38\nNDP 1\nThe main effort is supported directly and indirectly by all\nparts of the force.

Consequently, naval forces carry their own\nammunition, spares, and consumables  as well as support and repair\nfacilities for use early in a crisis or throughout a protracted conflict.\nThis self-sustainability provides the National Command Authorities\ncritical time to create an environment that will bring success. Our\nships are designed to travel significant distances without replenish-\nment. They carry the striking power of aircraft, guns, missiles, and\nMarine forces that can execute operations ashore immediately, with-\nout an assembly period or a lengthy logistics buildup. If conflict should\ncontinue over an extended period, naval forces can remain on station\nthrough augmentation and resupply by combat logistics ships. With\nprovisions made for on-station replacement of personnel and ships,\nsuch operations can be continued indefinitely.\nA Mobile Force\nNaval forces, with their strategic and tactical mobility, have\nthe ability to monitor a situation passively, remain on station for a\nsustained period, respond to a crisis rapidly, and maneuver in combat\nwith authority. Naval forces can respond from over the horizon,\nbecoming selectively visible and threatening to adversaries, as needed.\nIf diplomatic, political, or economic measures succeed, our agility\npermits us to withdraw promptly from the area without further ac-\ntion or buildup ashore.\nMobility enables naval forces to respond to indications of\npending crises by relocating rapidly from one end of the theater to\nanother or from one theater to another, independent of fixed logis-\ntics. Operational speed is part of our flexibility.

To cover all\npossibilities, the enemy may be forced to spread his defenses too\nwidely, thus exposing vulnerabilities.\nMobility is a key to decisive naval operations. The ability to\nmaneuver ships into position to strike vulnerable targets, or to\nthreaten amphibious assault at multiple locations along an extended\ncoastline, is a significant tactical and operational advantage. After we\nhave launched our strikes, our ships can press the advantage, maneu-\nver out of range, or reposition themselves for the next strike phase. In\namphibious operations, we place troops in a position to attack the\nweakness of the enemy while avoiding his main strength. A landing\nforces ability to maneuver from attack positions over the horizon\nthrough designated penetration points  without a slowdown or loss\nof momentum  could be critical to the success of the landing. When\nthe Marines have accomplished their mission ashore, they can\nbackload to await the next contingency.\nSupported by a rich maritime heritage, the strength of our\nnaval Services continues to reside in our well-trained, high-quality\npeople  active duty, reserves, and civilian. They remain at the heart\nof our force readiness and warfighting effectiveness. As a team, oper-\nating at sea and in the worlds littorals, naval forces are able to shift\nquickly from low-profile, passive, forward-deployed operations to\nhigh-tempo crisis response.

To carry out our naval roles, we must\nbe ready to conduct prompt and sustained combat operations  to\nfight and win at sea, on land, and in the air.

Gaining and maintaining control of the sea and establishing\nour forward sea lines of communication are our next priorities. As we\noperate in littoral areas of the world on a continuing basis, naval\nforces provide military power for projection against tactical, opera-\ntional, and strategic targets. In both peace and war, we frequently\ncarry out our roles through campaigns. A campaign, although often\nused only in the context of war, is a progression of related military\noperations aimed at attaining common objectives. Campaigns focus\non the operational level of war.\nHistoric Photograph of Nimitz Signing Japanese Surrender\nThe concept of levels of war can help us visualize the relative\ncontribution of military objectives toward achieving overall national\ngoals and offer us a way to place in perspective the causes and effects\nof our specific objectives, planning, and actions. There are three levels:\ntactical, operational, and strategic  each increasingly broader in\nscope. Although the levels do not have precise boundaries, in general\nFleet Admiral Chester W.

Within\neach specific campaign were a series of important and often decisive\nbattles. At the tactical level, each contributed to the achievement of\nthat campaigns objectives. The culmination of these campaign objec-\ntives	DEPARTMENT OF THE NAVY\nOFFICE OF THE CHIEF OF NAVAL OPERATIONS\nWASHINGTON, DC 20350-2000\nAND\nHEADQUARTERS UNITED STATES MARINE CORPS\nWASHINGTON, DC 20380-0001
america_Naval_doctrine_17	America	Naval	resulted in overall victory in the Pacific theater.\nThe naval contribution in the Pacific in World War II exem-\nplifies all the strategies of campaigning: protection of U.S. ports;\nmaneuver warfare at sea to check the advance of the Japanese Navy;\nsubmarine warfare against Japanese shipping; war at sea to gain con-\ntrol of the sea; and amphibious assault of enemy-held islands, pushing\nthe enemy back and forcing his final unconditional surrender. Cam-\npaigning is not an activity seen only in war. In peace, naval forces\nactively engage in forward presence and peace-support campaigns.\nToday, campaigns range from supporting economic sanctions im-\nposed by United Nations and other international organizations, to\nmaintaining a visible deterrent to regional aggression, and to efforts\nthat stem the flow of illicit drug traffic.\nDeterrence\nIt is our nations policy to deter aggression. Deterrence is the\nstate of mind brought about by a credible threat of retaliation, a\nconviction that the action being contemplated cannot succeed, or a\nbelief that the costs of the action will exceed any possible gain. Thus, the\npotential aggressor is reluctant to act for fear of failure, costs, and\nconsequences. The presence of naval forces or their movement to a\ncrisis area are two of the strongest deterrent signals we can send. They\nare unequivocal evidence that a fully combat-ready force stands poised\nto protect our national interests, and that additional force  whatever\nit takes  will be forthcoming. Our naval forces are the leading edge\nof the worlds most capable military, and their well-understood ability\nto project power is a key factor in deterrence. Forward deployed naval\n18\nNDP 1\nforces are available to respond quickly, require minimal support,\nand are not restricted in their movements.

Credible nuclear deterrence is based on adequate capa-\nbility and the certitude that our nation can and will inflict\nunacceptable losses on any adversary that uses nuclear weapons to\nattack the United States or its allies. Although the risk of a global\nnuclear conflict has diminished significantly, proliferation of nuclear\nweapons is continuing, and the danger of attack from an unstable,\nhostile, and irresponsible maverick state or terrorist organization\ncannot be discounted. Since deterring nuclear attack remains the high-\nest defense priority of the nation, we maintain a credible, survivable,\nsea-based strategic deterrent capability through continued deployment\nof ballistic-missile submarines.\nSSBN Photograph\nNDP 1\n19\nConventional Deterrence\nThe proliferation of weapons of mass destruction  including\nchemical and biological weapons  and other threats such as terror-\nism directed against U.S., allied, and other friendly nations interests\ndictate that we maintain a full array of retaliatory capabilities. Our\nnations clear willingness to employ its military might against adver-\nsaries who may consider employing such weapons will remain our\nprimary deterrent to their use. Chemical or biological weapons are so\nrepulsive to world society that most major countries are signatories to\ninternational treaties banning the production, storage, and use of\nsuch weapons. The United States is a party to these treaties. Yet, chemi-\ncal and biological weapons already exist in many countries and they\nare still proliferating. Our nations continuing involvement with\nfriends, allies, and potential coalition partners is helping to dissuade\nfurther proliferation and buildup of these arsenals. By being able to\ndepend on the strength and commitment of the United States, friendly\nnations should not feel the need to own weapons of mass destruction\nfor their defense.

Our\nnations use or threatened use of our conventional military force in\nthe past has contributed to deterrence by showing national interest,\nresolve, and capability to influence events. Naval forces can move\nrapidly to a specific area to influence political action. In such a show\nof force, we establish credibility by demonstrating our readiness to use\nforce if necessary. A show of force can be particularly effective when\nconducted with allies to prove solidarity and resolve. Limited use of\nforce includes counterterrorist operations, self-defense, retaliatory\nraids, rescue operations, or a direct attack to achieve a specific objective.\nIn this sense, it is the employment of military force by the National\nCommand Authorities without a formal declaration of war.\n20\nNDP 1\nForward Presence\nOverseas presence promotes national influence and access to\ncritical global areas, builds regional coalitions and collective security,\nfurthers stability, deters aggression, and provides initial crisis-response\ncapability. Naval presence is more than the day-to-day operation of\nour forces in a forward region. Those operations have crucial signifi-\ncance, but governments, like individuals, react to change. The sortie of\npowerful forces such as the repositioning of a highly visible carrier\nbattle group or an amphibious ready group sends a powerful signal to\nthe political leaders of nations or regimes who might seek to press\ntheir temporary advantage against U.S. interests.

Such a forward presence enables us to support our secu-\nrity interests and is a critical element in encouraging regional stability\nand continuing world confidence in Americas leadership.\nForward presence assures our nation that potential partners\nwill join with us when the time comes. In addition to assured U.S.\nresponse, an adversary may be deterred from conducting hostile\nactions if he perceives that  regional neighbors will actively oppose\nhim. A strong balance of power in a region can isolate an aggressor.\nOne way to establish this deterrent environment is through coali-\ntions and alliances. Our nation promotes stability throughout the\nworld by establishing supportive relationships with responsible na-\ntions to ensure that the balance of power discourages aggression. In\nthe face of enemy threats, these allies and coalition partners need the\nassurance of knowing they are joining the side that will win.

To bring this\nabout in a confluence of complex warfighting needs, we focus on\nstandardization and improving our interoperability with other Ser-\nvices. This may require rethinking our force organization and even\nour warfighting methodologies. Members of each Service  from\nwarfighter to planner  must be thoroughly trained to gain expertise\nin each others doctrine and capabilities. Training, education, and\nexperience developed in frequent joint operations and exercises \nwhere we explore and develop innovations and new doctrine  ad-\nvance our understanding of ways to work with each other efficiently.\nThis knowledge permits us to integrate basic warfighting principles\nproperly and to support effectively the Joint Force Commanders\nintent and focus of effort. Success in joint warfare depends on mutual\nunderstanding and cooperation. Coherent joint doctrine is the cata-\nlyst for this essential cooperation between Services. Our naval doc-\ntrine must fully support and be a logical extension of joint doctrine.\n26\nNDP 1\nNaval Operations in War\nControl of the sea is fundamental to accomplishing our naval\nroles.

Control of the sea allows us to:\nl Protect sea lines of communication.\nl Deny the enemy commercial and military use of the seas.\nl Establish an area of operations for power projection\nashore and support of amphibious operations.\nl Protect naval logistic support to forward deployed battle\nforces.\nControl of the sea can be accomplished through decisive operations by:\nl Destroying or neutralizing enemy ships, submarines,\naircraft, or mines.\nl Disabling or disrupting enemy command and control.\nl Destroying or neutralizing the land-based infrastructure\nthat supports enemy sea control forces.\nl Seizing islands, choke points, peninsulas, and coastal\nbases along the littorals.\nl Conducting barrier operations in choke points that pre-\nvent enemy mobility under, on, and above the sea.\nBy establishing control of the sea in every dimension, thus\nensuring access to an adversarys coast from the sea, we open oppor-\ntunities for power projection, insertion and resupply. Control of the\nsea, however, has both spatial and temporal limits. It does not imply\nabsolute control over all the seas at all times. Rather, control of the\nsea is required in specific regions for particular periods of time, to\nallow unencumbered maritime operations.\nNDP 1\n27\nWar From the Sea\nControl of the sea is usually a prerequisite for  larger strategies\ninvolving a land-based objective. Our national well-being may require\nthat we direct military power or threaten its use against an adversarys\nvital interests or homeland. War from the sea is the extension of our\nnaval influence through power projection over the shore. Amphibious\nassault capability is an integral component of our overall naval forces.\nMaritime forces provide not only sea lines of communication to\nbring men and materiel to the area of concern, but also mobile bases\nfrom which to conduct military operations.

It means ap-\nplying high-intensity, precise, offensive power at the time and place of\nour choosing. We provide commanders with a full range of power\nprojection options that include: employment of long range, accurate\ncruise missiles; Marines conducting high-speed maneuver across the\nshore and inland aided by naval surface fire support; and a great\nvariety of weapons released from naval strike aircraft.\n28\nNDP 1\nIn some cases, power projection by naval forces alone may\nbe sufficient to meet national objectives. But, the teamwork and\ndiversity that enable naval forces to dominate all dimensions of the\nbattlespace simultaneously while conducting strike operations also\nfacilitate the addition of joint, multinational, or coalition forces.\nArriving at the scene of a crisis with a flexible command and con-\ntrol structure already in place and operating, a naval forces com-\nmander can command a Joint Task Force afloat or shift command\nashore, depending on the tactical situation. When acting as an\nenabling force,7 the naval component may conduct operations\ninitially to seize a hostile port facility or airfield as a precursor to\nthe arrival of airlift, sealift, and prepositioned assets. After achiev-\ning maritime and air superiority, naval forces can continue to\noperate as an integrated part of a larger joint organization or\ndisengage to respond to another need for their presence.\nWar at Sea\nWar at sea is the application of decisive offensive force to\nachieve control of the sea. It conjures visions of classic struggles for\ndominance between battle fleets armed with short-range weapons and\nmaneuvering within sight of each other  relics of a past when the\nmost heavily armed ship was the arbiter of national power.

Dominating the enemy at sea\npermits our forces to maintain a forward presence and is the first step\nin establishing our superiority in any region. War at sea emphasizes\nthe offensive, bringing to bear information, intelligence, and tactical\ninitiative against an adversary. It requires appropriate and well-under-\nstood rules of engagement at the brink of war to win the first clash\nof arms. But offensive action is incomplete without full consideration\nof defensive requirements. Success in engagements at sea demands\npreparation to counter an adversarys gunfire, missiles, torpedoes,\nand mines. Additionally, we must thwart the enemys information\nbase  his capability to control his forces and to locate and target ours\n while enhancing our own. War at sea involves fully integrated\noffensive and defensive tactics that span the subsurface, surface, air,\nspace, and electromagnetic environments.\nIn accomplishing our assigned roles, naval Services prepare to\nfight and win wars. We also play an important role in preventing\nthem. Routine forward presence establishes and maintains regional,\neconomic and political stability and deters aggression. We further\nstrengthen positive relations with our world neighbors day-to-day by\nproviding humanitarian assistance and supporting operations other\nthan war.

So it is with strategy . . . It is for this\nreason that in the study of war we must get our theory clear before we\ncan venture in search of practical conclusions.”\n— Sir Julian Corbett, 1911\nW\nar is an instrument of a nations power, initiated to\nachieve national objectives when other means to\nresolve differences have failed. Our fundamental\nmilitary purpose is to attain national policy objectives through our\ncapacity to wage war successfully. How well we in the Naval Services\naccomplish our mission depends on how thoroughly we understand\nboth the nature and the conduct of war and learn wars many lessons.\nOnly through such understanding can we prepare ourselves for its tests.\nTwo Styles of Warfare\nNaval forces have followed several styles or philosophies of\nwarfare throughout history. Two specific types  attrition and\nmaneuver  have evolved in response to particular needs and force\ncapabilities. Although they vary significantly in efficiency, flexibility,\nand decisiveness, each type of warfare has its own utility, depending\non circumstances, and both types are conducted today.\n32\nNDP 1\nTHE BATTLE OF THE ATLANTIC\nUsing Attrition Warfare\nIn World War II, allied naval forces engaged in attrition warfare by\nemploying their resources against the German undersea fleet. Analyzing the\neffectiveness of submarine warfare, the former Soviet Union Admiral of the	DEPARTMENT OF THE NAVY\nOFFICE OF THE CHIEF OF NAVAL OPERATIONS\nWASHINGTON, DC 20350-2000\nAND\nHEADQUARTERS UNITED STATES MARINE CORPS\nWASHINGTON, DC 20380-0001
america_Naval_doctrine_29	America	Naval	Fleet,\nSergei Gorshkov, noted in his study of this period that German submarines nearly\nended the war through the rapid destruction of the allied merchant fleet. German\nforces, especially U-boats, were credited with sinking more than 2,800 merchant ships\n 68% of all tonnage sunk by Nazi Germany in the war. So devastating was this\nweapon that, at the height of the allied counteroffensive, for each German U-boat,\nthere were 25 U.S. and British warships and 100 aircraft in pursuit. For every German\nsubmariner at sea, there were 100 American and British antisubmariners. A total of\nsix million men, 5,500 specially constructed ships, and 20,000 small craft were\ndedicated to the antisubmarine war. As the allies pressed their offensive, Germanys\nlosses exceeded its war industrys capacity to keep pace. At the same time, the allies\nwere able to replace their damaged merchant fleet and even expanded it by adding\nreplacements numbering twice the losses suffered. In the Battle of the Atlantic, the\nthreat of the U-boat was checked by overwhelming allied response. This resource-\nintensive, time-consuming effort was an effective use of attrition warfare.\nBattle of the Atlantic\nNDP 1\n33\nAttrition Warfare\nA key difference between attrition warfare  the wearing\ndown of an enemy  and maneuver warfare  a high tempo, indirect\nphilosophy  is our method of engaging the enemy. In the days of\nsail, fleet line tactics were much less involved. Ships in single lines\nexchanged heavy broadsides against an enemy similarly arrayed, all\nwithin sight of each other. Their simple doctrine called for sailing\ndirectly to the enemys location and systematically engaging his fleet.\nAttrition warfare is the application of our strength against an\nenemys strength. It is typically a linear or two-dimensional style of\nfighting that is frequently indecisive and inherently costly in terms of\npersonnel, resources, and time. When success in war on the opera-\ntional and strategic levels depends on our	DEPARTMENT OF THE NAVY\nOFFICE OF THE CHIEF OF NAVAL OPERATIONS\nWASHINGTON, DC 20350-2000\nAND\nHEADQUARTERS UNITED STATES MARINE CORPS\nWASHINGTON, DC 20380-0001
america_Naval_doctrine_30	America	Naval	ability to destroy or deny\nthe enemy crucial resources faster than he can recover, we are em-\nploying classic attrition warfare techniques. We attrite the enemy\nthrough systematic application of overwhelming force that reduces\nhis ability or capacity to resist.\nManeuver Warfare\nNaval forces also have used the preferable and more effective\n albeit more difficult to master  fighting style known as maneuver\nwarfare. Closely associated with the writings of Sun Tzu and used by\nthe great practitioners of expeditionary, naval, and land war, maneu-\nver warfare is a philosophy, rather than a formula  an approach,\nrather than a recipe. Like attrition warfare, it has long served as com-\nmon doctrine for naval forces. It emphasizes the need to give the\ncommander freedom to deal with specific situations. Maneuver war-\nfare is further characterized by adaptability and is not limited to a\nparticular environment. Though enhanced by a variety of technolo-\ngies, it is not dependent upon any one of them.\nManeuver warfare emphasizes the indirect approach  not\nmerely in terms of mobility and spatial movement, but also in terms\nof time and our ability to take action before the enemy can counter\nus. Maneuver warfare requires us to project combat power. Unlike\nattrition warfare, however, this power is focused on key enemy weak-\nnesses and vulnerabilities that allow us to strike the source of his\npower  the key to his existence and strength as a military threat.\n34\nNDP 1\nINCHON - SEOUL\nUsing Maneuver Warfare\n “The Navy and the Marines have never shone\nmore brightly than this morning .”\n— General Douglas MacArthur, 15 September 1950\nThe amphibious operation at Inchon in the Korean War was a\nclassic example of how the naval Services have employed maneuver warfare.\nPrior to the operation, the North Korean Peoples Army had driven the\nU.S. and allied forces into a constricted corner of South Korea and\nthreatened to push them from the peninsula altogether. Even though his\nforces were in	DEPARTMENT OF THE NAVY\nOFFICE OF THE CHIEF OF NAVAL OPERATIONS\nWASHINGTON, DC 20350-2000\nAND\nHEADQUARTERS UNITED STATES MARINE CORPS\nWASHINGTON, DC 20380-0001
america_Naval_doctrine_31	America	Naval	dire straits, General Douglas MacArthur, Supreme\nCommander of the United Nations forces in Korea, recognized that the\nnaval Services in his command had the ability to reverse dramatically the tide\nof the battle. A landing on the Korean peninsula north of the enemy lines,\nhe reasoned, would allow his forces to sever the critical north/south rail and\nroad supply lines running through nearby Seoul that provided vital support\nto the North Korean siege of the Pusan perimeter. By 15 September 1950,\nU.S. Navy surface combatants and carrier air squadrons, along with shore-\nbased Marine and Air Force air units, had cleared Korean waters and air\nspace of North Korean opposition. Thus protected and concealed from the\nenemy, Vice Admiral Arthur D. Strubles nine-navy, 260-ship, Joint Task\nForce Seven transported Army and South Korean ground units and the\namphibious-trained 1st Marine Division to the strategically important port\nof Inchon, north of enemy lines. These troops stormed ashore via lanes\ncleared of obstructions by naval underwater demolition teams and behind\nthe gunfire of four cruisers, eight destroyers, and the aircraft of six carriers.\nAmphibious support ships soon brought in reinforcements and the supplies\nneeded to maintain and expand the beachhead. This bold, surprise maneuver\nsevered the lines of communications to 90% of the enemys ground forces\npositioned far to the south opposite the UNs Pusan perimeter. By the end\nof September, faced with entrapment and almost certain destruction, the\nNorth Korean Peoples Army fled the Republic of Korea, a nation they had\ninvaded so eagerly only a few months before.\nNDP 1\n35\nThe Conduct of War\n“Hold the attention of your enemy with a minimum force, then\nquickly strike him suddenly and hard on his flank or rear with\nevery weapon you have.”\n— General A.A.

america_Naval_doctrine_32	America	Naval	Because protracted war can cause\nhigh casualties and unwanted political and economic consequences, the\nrapid conclusion of hostilities is a key goal. Maneuver warfare, based on\nthe twin pillars of decisiveness and rapidity, is our preferred style of\nwarfighting. It is as applicable today in the maritime environment as it\nhas been in traditional land warfare. Modern maneuver warfare requires\nintegration and understanding of four key concepts  center of gravity,\ncritical vulnerability, focus of effort, and main effort. We convey these\nconcepts in context to our forces using a mechanism called the\ncommanders intent.\nCenter of Gravity and Critical Vulnerability\nThe center of gravity is something the enemy must have to\ncontinue military operations  a source of his strength, but not nec-\nessarily strong or a strength in itself. There can only be one center of\ngravity. Once identified, we focus all aspects of our military, economic,\ndiplomatic, and political strengths against it. As an example, a lengthy\nresupply line supporting forces engaged at a distance from the home\nfront could be an enemys center of gravity. The resupply line is some-\nthing the enemy must have  a source of strength  but not necessarily\ncapable of protecting itself. Opportunities to access and destroy a cen-\nter of gravity are called critical vulnerabilities. To deliver a decisive blow\nto the enemys center of gravity, we must strike at objectives affecting\nthe center of gravity that are both critical to the enemys ability to fight\nand vulnerable to our offensive actions. If the object of a strike is not\ncritical  essential to the enemys ability to stay in the fight  the best\nresult we can achieve is some reduction in the enemys strength. Simi-\nlarly, if the object of a strike is not vulnerable to attack by our forces,\nthen any attempts to seize or destroy it will be futile.\n36\nNDP 1\nYORKTOWN\nExploiting A Critical Vulnerability\nDuring the Revolutionary War, British forces in North America	DEPARTMENT OF THE NAVY\nOFFICE OF THE CHIEF OF NAVAL OPERATIONS\nWASHINGTON, DC 20350-2000\nAND\nHEADQUARTERS UNITED STATES MARINE CORPS\nWASHINGTON, DC 20380-0001
america_Naval_doctrine_33	America	Naval	depended on free use of the adjacent seas to move and resupply their\nground troops. This became especially critical to the British ability to\ncontinue fighting in August 1781, on the peninsula between Virginias York\nand James Rivers, when American land forces successfully severed the British\nArmy under General Lord Cornwallis from their ground-based resupply. At\nthis location, British resupply by sea was vulnerable because access to  the\nYorktown port could be denied by controlling entry at the mouth of the\nChesapeake Bay. The French West Indian Fleet under Rear Admiral François\nde Grasse positioned itself at this strategic location in advance of the British\nfleet. When British Admiral Thomas Graves arrived to support Cornwallis,\nde Grasse maneuvered his ships to engage the enemy outside the bay. His\nactions not only denied Cornwallis his needed support, but permitted\nanother French squadron sailing from Rhode Island to enter the bay and\nreinforce American and French land forces. As a result, the British succumbed\nat Yorktown surrendering their entire Army of 7,600 men. The Franco-\nAmerican alliance was effective in blocking British access to and from the sea\nand thereby exploiting this critical vulnerability. Losing their ability to\nsustain their forces by sea doomed the British war effort in North America.\nBattle of Yorktown Chart\nNDP 1\n37\nThe appearance of critical vulnerabilities depends entirely\nupon the situation and specific objective. Some  such as electrical\npower generation and distribution facilities ashore or the fleet oilers\nsupporting a task group  may be obvious. On a strategic level,\nexamples may include a nations dependence on a certain raw mate-\nrial imported by sea to support its warfighting industry, or its depen-\ndence on a single source of intelligence data as the primary basis for\nits decisions. Alternatively, a critical vulnerability might be an intan-\ngible, such as morale. In any case, we define critical vulnerabilities by\nthe central	DEPARTMENT OF THE NAVY\nOFFICE OF THE CHIEF OF NAVAL OPERATIONS\nWASHINGTON, DC 20350-2000\nAND\nHEADQUARTERS UNITED STATES MARINE CORPS\nWASHINGTON, DC 20380-0001

A\ncommander may shift designation of the main effort as necessary and\nthat designation may assign the bulk of the force or only a small\nfraction of the resources available. Whatever the size, designation as\nthe main effort means that this element is central to the complete\nsuccess of the operation and supporting units are obligated to do\neverything they can to ensure that the main effort succeeds. Support-\ning units are crucial to the success of mission. Leaders of supporting\nunits, guided by the commanders intent, choose actions aimed at\ndoing all they can to support the main effort.\nCommander’s Intent\nDecisive action requires unity of effort  getting all parts of\na force to work together. Rapid action, on the other hand, requires a\nlarge degree of decentralization, giving those closest to the problem\nthe freedom to solve it. To reconcile these seemingly contradictory\nrequirements, we use our understanding of the main effort and a tool\ncalled the commanders intent.\nThe commanders intent conveys the end state, his desired\nresult of action. The concept of operations details the commanders\nestimated sequence of actions to achieve this end state and contains\nessential elements of a plan  i.e., what is to be done and how the\ncommander plans to do it. A commander issues the concept of\noperations as part of a formal operation plan or order. The\ncommanders intent differs from the concept of operations; a signifi-\ncant change in the situation that requires action often will alter the\nconcept of operations, but the commanders intent is overarching\nand usually remains unchanged. The commanders intent reflects his\nvision and conveys his thinking through mission-type orders, in\nwhich subordinates are encouraged to exercise initiative and are given\nthe freedom to act independently.\nNDP 1\n39\nMission-type orders define the contract that the commanders\nintent establishes between the delegating commander and his subor-\ndinates. We achieve	DEPARTMENT OF THE NAVY\nOFFICE OF THE CHIEF OF NAVAL OPERATIONS\nWASHINGTON, DC 20350-2000\nAND\nHEADQUARTERS UNITED STATES MARINE CORPS\nWASHINGTON, DC 20380-0001

Since stereotyped actions are\ninherently predictable and thus easily countered, commanders must\ntailor their actions to the situation at hand, using initiative, imagina-\ntion and experienced judgment.\nArleigh Burke on Ship\nEffective commanders at all levels neither expect nor attempt\nto control every action of their subordinates. Nor do they profess to\nforesee or attempt to plan for each contingency. Two great com-\nmanders in naval history, Admirals Horatio Nelson and Arleigh\nBurke, rarely issued detailed instructions to their subordinate\nCAPT Arleigh A. Burke, Commander of Destroyer Squadron 23, reading on\nthe bridge wing of his flagship, USS Charles Ausburne (DD-570), 1943\n40\nNDP 1\ncommanders. Instead, they frequently gathered their captains to dis-\ncuss a variety of tactical problems. Because of these informal discus-\nsions, the captains became aware of what their commanders expected\nto accomplish and how they planned, in various situations, to accom-\nplish it. Thus prepared, they later were able to act independently,\nfollowing their commanders intent, even though formal orders ei-\nther were brief or nonexistent.\nThe commanders intent is particularly important in cases\nwhere the situation that gave rise to orders has changed and, as a\nresult, the original orders are no longer applicable. In such cases,\nsubordinates can structure their decisions by asking such questions as\nWhat would my commander want me to do in this situation? and\nWhat can I do to help my commander attain the objectives?\nTempo\nUsing the philosophy of maneuver warfare, we destroy or elimi-\nnate an adversarys center of gravity indirectly by attacking weak-\nnesses or vulnerabilities that are vital to his source of power. One\nmethod of indirect attack is to create a	DEPARTMENT OF THE NAVY\nOFFICE OF THE CHIEF OF NAVAL OPERATIONS\nWASHINGTON, DC 20350-2000\nAND\nHEADQUARTERS UNITED STATES MARINE CORPS\nWASHINGTON, DC 20380-0001

This is an indirect approach.\nThrough rapid high-tempo actions, we  present him with a series of\nunexpected situations and developments, each of which demands a\nresponse. In the ideal situation, the enemy would find that his best\ncounter in one situation puts him at unacceptable risk in another \na no-win situation.\nA powerful enemy can protect his critical vulnerabilities. A\nskillful enemy may disperse them. In each case, there is little chance of\nstriking a decisive blow unless such an enemy can be forced to expose\none or more of his critical vulnerabilities. One way of doing this is to\nexploit the dynamics of warfighting by maintaining a high tempo.\nTempo is the pace of action  the rate at which we drive events. A\nrapid tempo requires that commanders be provided timely, accurate\nintelligence to find enemy weaknesses, enough decentralization to\nallow subordinate commanders to exploit opportunities, and clearly\nunderstood and well-rehearsed procedures at the lowest levels.\nNDP 1\n41\nThe decision cycle is a vital aspect of tempo. Forces with rapid\ndecision cycles enjoy an advantage over those whose leaders need more\ntime to gather and process information before making decisions.\nTempo is more than a means to employ weapons better; it is a weapon\nitself. Directed against an enemy with a slower decision cycle, a series\nof rapid and unexpected attacks on critical vulnerabilities can be\noverwhelming, depriving him of his power to react effectively and\nultimately destroying his center of gravity.\nAs in the martial art of judo, the objective in fighting with\na high tempo is to take action that sets in motion a series of\nactions and reactions, each of which potentially exposes  if only\nfor a brief time  a critical vulnerability. In such a contest, we\nachieve victory by making the most rapid and unpredictable moves\nspecifically selected to	DEPARTMENT OF THE NAVY\nOFFICE OF THE CHIEF OF NAVAL OPERATIONS\nWASHINGTON, DC 20350-2000\nAND\nHEADQUARTERS UNITED STATES MARINE CORPS\nWASHINGTON, DC 20380-0001

It is an aggressive style of\nwarfare in which we gain advantage by observing the enemy, ori-\nenting ourselves to these surroundings, deciding on a move, and\nacting more rapidly than the enemy.\nOn a tactical level, this warfighting technique, formally noted\nin the extraordinary success enjoyed by U.S. pilots during the Korean\nWar,8 also served as the root of success in similar experiences of naval\naviators during the latter stages of the Vietnam War.\n8 A discussion of air-to-air combat in the Korean War can be found in Boyd, John R.\nCol. USAF (Ret.), Patterns of Conflict, an unpublished lecture cited in William S.\nLind, Maneuver Warfare Handbook (Boulder, Co.: Westview Press, 1985), pp 4-6.\n42\nNDP 1\nAIR COMBAT MANEUVERING\nTactical Use of Tempo\nDuring the early stages of the Vietnam War, our aircraft exchange\nrate in combat was only two to one. Air-to-air missiles, thought to be the\ntechnological answer to future aerial combat, were ineffective in many cases.\nOur pilots needed to develop close-in maneuvering skills and proficiency in\nthe use of their missiles as well as newly installed guns to counter the principal\ncommunist fighters, the MiG-series.\nIn several traditional measures of aircraft performance the MiG was\nsuperior to the U.S. F-4.

Activity\nat the operational level must contribute directly to the military stra-\ntegic aim. Such aims, broadly set, demand that the operational com-\nmander have wide-ranging independence to exercise creativity and\noriginality. Such freedom allows him to gain and retain the initiative\nand adapt to the developing situation. Mission-type orders, specifying\na result but leaving open the methods of attaining that result, allow\nthe decentralization necessary for local rapid response.\nSuccess in war depends upon properly implementing our over-\nall warfighting philosophy which includes understanding the\ncommanders intent and the concepts center of gravity, critical vul-\nnerabilities, focus of effort, and main effort. Additionally, we must\ncorrectly apply the basic tenets or principles of war.9 The principles of\nwar are based on hard-won and often bitter experience gained in\nconflict. These important lessons emphasize its nature and form the\nbasis for our warfighting doctrine.\nThe Principles of War\nAn important issue throughout military history has been the way\na military organization addresses the qualities that war demands from its\nparticipants. Military leadership has dealt best with the intractable prob-\nlems of war as a form of military and naval art. In the maritime environ-\nment, with its distinctive factors, we fight using the principles that apply\nto combat everywhere.

Direct every military operation toward a clearly\ndefined, decisive, and attainable objective. The naval Services\nfocus their operations to achieve political purposes defined by\nthe National Command Authorities. With national strategic\npurpose identified, we can select theater military objectives\nand form operational and tactical objectives based on specific\nmissions and capabilities. Whether the objective is destroying\nan enemys armed forces or merely disrupting his ability to\nuse his forces effectively, the most significant preparation a\ncommander can make is to express clearly the objective of the\noperation to subordinate commanders.\n l Mass. Concentrate combat power at the decisive time and\nplace. Use strength against weakness. A force, even one smaller\nthan its adversary, can achieve decisive results when it concen-\ntrates or focuses its assets on defeating an enemys critical\nvulnerability. A naval task force, using the sea as an ally, can\ncompensate for numerical inferiority through the principle of\nmass. Mass further implies an ability to sustain momentum\nfor decisive results.\nHistoric photograph showing concentration of forces\nNDP 1\n45\n l Maneuver. Place the enemy in a position of disadvantage\nthrough the feasible application of combat power. Use of\nmaneuver (mobility) capitalizes on the speed and agility of\nour forces (platforms and weapons) to gain an advantage in\ntime and space relative to the enemys vulnerabilities. Whether\nseen in historic warships crossing the T, or modern ground\nforces enveloping an enemy, or forcing the tempo of combat\nbeyond an adversarys ability to respond, maneuver allows us\nto get ahead of the enemy in several dimensions.

Seize, retain, and exploit the initiative. Since the\ndays of sail  racing an opponent for the upwind advantage\nto take the initiative  offensive action has allowed us to set\nthe terms and select the place of confrontation, exploit vulner-\nabilities and seize opportunities from unexpected develop-\nments. Taking the offensive through initiative is a philosophy\nwe use to employ available forces intelligently to deny an\nenemy his freedom of action.\n46\nNDP 1\n l Economy of Force. Employ all combat power available in the most\neffective way possible; allocate minimum essential combat power to sec-\nondary efforts. With many more available targets than assets, each\nunit must focus its attention on the primary objectives. A success-\nfully coordinated naval strike at an enemys critical vulnerability\n for example, knocking specific command-and-control nodes\nout of commission  can have far more significance than an\nattempt to destroy the entire command-and-control system.\nl Unity of Command. Ensure unity of effort for every objective\nunder one responsible commander. Whether the scope of re-\nsponsibility involves a single, independent ship at sea or the\nconduct of an amphibious landing, we achieve unity in forces\nby assigning a single commander. After he expresses his intent\nand provides an overall focus, he permits subordinate com-\nmanders to make timely, critical decisions and maintain a\nhigh tempo in pursuit of a unified objective. The result is\nsuccess, generated by unity in purpose, unit cohesion, and\nflexibility in responding to the uncertainties of combat.\n l Simplicity.

Strike the enemy at a time or place or in a manner for\nwhich he is unprepared. Catching the enemy off guard immedi-\nately puts him on the defensive, allowing us to drive events. The\nelement of surprise is desirable, but it is not essential that the\nenemy be taken completely unaware  only that he becomes\naware too late to react effectively. Concealing our capabilities and\nintentions by using covert techniques and deceptions gives us the\nopportunity to strike the enemy when he is not ready.\nSEALS landing on beach  Photograph\nl Security. Never permit the enemy to acquire unexpected advan-\ntage. Protecting the force increases our combat power. The alert\nwatchstander, advanced picket, or such measures as electronic\nemission control all promote our freedom of action by reducing\nour vulnerability to hostile acts, influence, or surprise.

The priceless advantage\nafforded by intercepting Japanese communications gave the Americans\nunprecedented knowledge of enemy intentions and force dispositions.\nEvery available carrier and escort the United States could muster was\nassigned to the operation  including the carrier Yorktown, which made a\nhasty sortie after repairs thought impossible by the Japanese Naval Staff.\nNevertheless, the U.S. force was numerically inferior to the Japanese striking\ngroup. Nimitz assigned Rear Admiral Frank Jack Fletcher, a veteran of battle\nwho had recently faced Japanese carrier forces at Coral Sea, as the officer in\ntactical command. Nimitzs objectives were clear and simple: hold Midway\nand inflict maximum damage on the enemy by strong attrition tactics. Nimitz\nfurther added In carrying out the task assigned . . . you will be guided by the\nprinciples of calculated risk. Fletcher had unity of command and broad\nlatitude in executing his tasks. He directed Rear Admiral Raymond A. Spruance,\n        Fletcher\n     Spruance\nCommander Task Force 16, to attack the enemy carriers as soon as the ships\nwere located. Fletcher, embarked in the carrier Yorktown  with Task Force 17,\nwould follow soon afterward. Early in the battle, when enemy air attacks placed\nhis flagship out of action, Fletcher transferred that unity of command to\nSpruance who retained tactical control for most of the fight.\nKnowledge of the Japanese plan allowed Nimitz to invoke economy\nof force by deploying minimal forces in front of a Japanese diversion toward\nthe Aleutian Islands while massing his most effective combat power  his\nthree aircraft carriers  against the main enemy thrust at Midway. Also, knowing\nthat the Japanese would use submarines and long-range flying boats to determine\nif the U.S. fleet had sortied from Pearl Harbor, Nimitz used maneuver to\nfrustrate the operation of these enemy units.

To retain their advantage, U.S. units maintained security through\nradio silence and darken-ship procedures at night. The fact that the U.S.\ncarriers had departed the base before the battle was not known to Yamamoto.\nThe Japanese were also conscious of the need for security and surprise. In\ncontrast, however, excessive emphasis on security and surprise actually worked\nagainst Yamamoto and Nagumo. Convinced that the invading force would\ncatch the island of Midway unprepared, the Japanese admirals failed to assess\nfully the size and location of their opposing forces. Complete reconnaissance\nwould have shown that the U.S. Navy did not have adequate fleet strength at\nthe time to win in a direct at-sea confrontation. The Japanese could have\nconcentrated their efforts against Fletchers and Spruances forces and then\nattacked the lightly defended Midway later.\nOn the morning of June 4, 1942, Nagumo launched a routine,\nlimited dawn air search, convinced that the Americans could not be in the\nvicinity. He then followed with his initial attack against Midway, opposed only\nby the relatively few ground-based Navy, Marine Corps and Army Air Corps\nsearch, attack, and fighter aircraft on the island. By the time Japanese\nreconnaissance aircraft did discover the presence of the American force, it\nwas too late. After the Japanese aerial assault, Spruance and his staff reasoned\nthat Yamamotos force might be in the process of recovering their aircraft and\npreparing for additional land attacks. Seizing the initiative, Fletcher and\n         Yamamoto                                            Nagumo\nSpruance immediately attacked the Japanese carriers with every aircraft available.\nAlthough outnumbered, Fletcher and Spruance maintained an aggressive\noffensive.

When the dive bombers from\nYorktown and Enterprise arrived at the battle site, the fight was taking place\nat low altitude, allowing them to attack Yamamotos force unimpeded. In fact,\nthe American air strike did surprise the Japanese carriers in an exceptionally\nvulnerable situation  with unstowed ordnance and bomb- and torpedo-laden\nplanes on deck being refueled. In the fighting that followed, the Japanese lost\nthe carriers Hiryu, Soryu, Akagi, and Kaga and their scores of veteran aviators.\nDeprived of air cover, Admiral Yamamoto canceled the planned invasion of\nMidway Island. The Japanese never regained the initiative in the Pacific.\nAdmiral  Isoroku Yamamoto\nAdmiral Chuichi Nagumo\n50\nNDP 1\nThe principles of war have been proven effective in prepar-\ning for combat, but the complexities and disorder of war preclude\ntheir use as a simple checklist.

It is au-\nthoritative but requires judgment in application.\n— Joint PUB 1-02, DOD Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms\nDoctrine is the heart of naval warfare.

Within the broader guidelines of national strategy, doc-\ntrine provides the basis for mutual understanding and trust within\nour naval Services as well as with other Services and our national\nNDP 1\n51\nleaders. It is not a set of concrete rules, but rather a basis of common\nunderstanding throughout the chain of command. Composed of\nshared convictions that guide naval forces as a whole, it fuses our\nService-unique tactics, techniques, procedures, and warfighting\nphilosophies.\nTactics is the art of selecting the right tools for the job. A\ntechnique describes a way systems or units can be employed in com-\nbat. Our choice of specific techniques  as well as ways we might\ncombine them  depends on many factors, including the overall\noperating situation and surrounding environment. Techniques specify\nways to use various systems. Procedures provide us with instructions\nfor specific systems and equipments. Techniques and procedures are\ntools a commander employs in his tactics. For example, procedures\ntell us how to maintain a particular weapon system; a technique\ndescribes ways to employ it against an enemy threat; and tactics is the\nart of choosing the right systems and techniques for the situation.\nDoctrine is the underlying philosophy that guides our use of tactics\nand weapons systems to achieve a common objective.\nNaval doctrine forms a bridge between the naval component\nof our nations military strategy and our tactics, techniques and pro-\ncedures, such as those found in our Naval Warfare Publications and\nFleet Marine Force Manuals.

It is based on the commanders preparation\nof the battlespace,11 a formal evaluation, supported by intelligence,\nthat integrates enemy doctrine with such factors as physical and en-\nvironmental conditions. From this evaluation, the commander iden-\ntifies the forces and support needed to execute the plan within a\ntheater of operations. Naval forces operation plans are integrated\ninto the complete inventory available to the Joint Force Commander.\nFor execution, plans become operation orders. Operation plans in-\nclude: the theater strategy or general concept and the organizational\nrelationships; the logistics plan shows ways the force will be supported;\nand the deployment plan sequences the movement of the force and its\nlogistical support into the theater. Elements of planning that produce\na concept of operations include the commanders estimate, deciding\npossible courses of action, preparation of the mission statement and\nits execution strategy, situation analysis, and formulation of the\ncommanders intent.

In a naval context, we use battlespace to mean analysis of the physical and environmen-\ntal characteristics of a geographic area and its effects on our ability to establish superiority in\nevery dimension of this space.

This is especially true when we employ high-tempo\noperations characteristic in maneuver warfare. High tempo involves\nrisks when all possible information is not available at the time deci-\nsions must be made and executed. We are sometimes placed in a posi-\ntion of weighing certainty in outcome against the benefits of taking\nprompt action. We have seen how prompt, decisive action can have\nsignificant advantages in keeping ahead of the enemys decision-and-\naction cycle. The risk of uncertainty in our decisions must be balanced\nby the gains of striking during a fleeting window of opportunity. Every\ncommander can expect to be faced with accepting a certain level of risk\nin conflict.

Because risk is often related to gain, leaders weigh the risks\nagainst the benefits to be obtained from an operation, recognizing\nthat unnecessary risk can be as great a hindrance to mission success\nas enemy action. On the other hand, carefully identifying the risks,\nanalyzing and controlling as many factors as possible, and executing\na supervised plan that accounts for these factors have contributed to\nthe success of some of the greatest military operations in history.\n56\nNDP 1\nNORMANDY\nAccounting for Risk in Warfare\nAn excellent application of risk assessment and risk management is\nillustrated in the largest amphibious operation ever conducted  the Allied\nlanding at Normandy, June 6, 1944. Operation Overlord was one of the\nmost intricately planned invasions in history. One uncertainty however, the\nweather, threatened its success. General Dwight Eisenhower, the Supreme\nCommander, Allied Expeditionary Forces, recognized that high winds, low\nclouds, and heavy seas converging in the objective area presented\nunacceptable risk to his forces. He therefore delayed the operation, despite\nthe realization that this might upset the precise timing of the enormous\nmilitary undertaking. Carefully monitoring the situation,  Eisenhower\nsought a balance where the advantage of attacking under adverse physical\nconditions, which might surprise the enemy not expecting him to take this\nrisk, would offset the hazards associated with the poor weather itself. After\n24 hours the weather had only moderately improved, but Eisenhower felt he\nhad found that balance. With the risk now warranted, he made his irrevocable\ndecision, launching a force of more than 5,000 vessels, 11,000 aircraft, and\n700,000 men, in one of the most significant joint and multinational\noperations of the war.\nNormandy Landing\nNDP 1\n57\nHow well we fight depends upon how we think	DEPARTMENT OF THE NAVY\nOFFICE OF THE CHIEF OF NAVAL OPERATIONS\nWASHINGTON, DC 20350-2000\nAND\nHEADQUARTERS UNITED STATES MARINE CORPS\nWASHINGTON, DC 20380-0001

Such options range from what has become our\nday-to-day peacetime employment  forward presence, humanitarian,\nand peacekeeping operations  to fighting in regional conflicts.\nNaval expeditionary forces can respond to crises unilaterally\nor provide the initial enabling capability for joint and multinational\noperations. These forces capitalize on the expanding capabilities of\nmodern naval forces to project power in an increasingly sophisti-\ncated and lethal environment. Our continuing challenge is to en-\nhance U.S. naval warfare superiority and contribute to our nations\ncampaigns, through teamwork and cooperation  particularly in\njoint and multinational operations. Our nations interest in remain-\ning engaged with other nations of the world forges special bonds with\nregional leaders. Naval presence is used to provide a regional stabi-\nlizing influence, foster strong alliances, and encourage multinational\nfriendships. This spirit of cooperation is desirable in deterring or\nconfronting crises.\nNDP 1\n61\nIn most contingencies, naval forces complement the capabili-\nties and resources of the Army and Air Force, and possibly forces of\nother nations.

In\npeacetime, command, control and surveillance systems permit us to\nmonitor situations of interest, giving us indications and warnings\nthat allow us to position our forces when necessary. In humanitarian\nrelief and other support operations, our command and control sys-\ntem becomes part of the overall network by tying together diverse\ngovernment and non-government agencies, as well as the many inter-\nnational and interservice forces that may join the operation.\nWarfare in every dimension of the battlespace  and even\nwithin many weapon systems  requires external information. Com-\nmanders and their forces have many requirements for information\nsuch as navigation, meteorology/oceanography, mapping/charting,\ncommunications, and evaluated information  intelligence. Because\ncommand, control, communications, computers, and intelligence\n(C4I) is so important, commanders also seek to degrade or interrupt\nan adversarys information support systems and structure. At the\nsame time, operations security is essential to deny the enemy knowl-\nedge of our capabilities and intentions. It also contributes to our\n62\nNDP 1\nability to exercise the element of surprise. Intelligence identifies key\nenemy information vulnerabilities and can allow the commander to\nfocus his resources against the enemys center of gravity.\nGood intelligence results from collection, processing, integra-\ntion, analysis, evaluation, and interpretation of available informa-\ntion concerning potential adversaries. It produces timely indications\nand warnings, locations, identifications, intentions, technical capa-\nbilities, and tactics of potential enemies and other countries of inter-\nest.

Space systems rapidly collect and distribute large\nvolumes of information. They also provide services that link widely\nseparated forces and provide an important advantage to naval\nforces in all areas of the world. Intelligence estimates, disseminated\nin a timely fashion, center on the focus of effort, identify critical\nvulnerabilities, and enhance combat effectiveness.\nNDP 1\n63\nIntegrating global C4I systems that directly link and support\nnaval forces and joint forces will provide us an accurate picture of the\nbattlespace. Some C4I operational capabilities include: enhanced battle\nmanagement systems; fully interoperable, user centered, multimedia\n(voice, video, and data) links; embedded cryptographic security; and\nthe ability to collect, evaluate, disseminate, and receive near-real-time,\nall-source, fused intelligence and surveillance data.\nTechnologically advanced equipment is available to any na-\ntion or individual that can afford to pay for it. It presents our poten-\ntial adversaries with new capabilities through off-the-shelf\ninformation-management systems, global navigation, and commer-\ncial communications. Nevertheless, these capabilities, though modern,\nare still vulnerable to exploitation through information warfare.\nControl of information exploitation is so important that it has be-\ncome a warfare objective in its own right. Battlespace dominance and\nprojection of power ashore are intricately linked with and dependent\nupon effective C4I capabilities.\nBattlespace Dominance\nModern battlespace is multidimensional.

The international community is facing its greatest \ntrial since World War II (WWII), and we have entered a new era of crisis.\nRussia’s aggression against Ukraine is an unprecedented situation. A permanent member of \nthe United Nations Security Council has shown disregard for international law by launching \nan aggression against a sovereign country and repeating rhetoric and actions that can be \ninterpreted as threats of nuclear weapons use. Additionally, China is rapidly enhancing its \nmilitary capability qualitatively and quantitatively, including nuclear and missile forces, while \ncontinuing and amplifying its unilateral changes to the status quo by force and such attempts \nin the East China Sea and the South China Sea. Furthermore, North Korea is rapidly advancing \nits nuclear and missile development, repeatedly launching missiles.\nUnder these circumstances, it goes without saying that diplomatic efforts are the foremost \npriority of Japan, which has experienced WWII and has since been pursuing the path of a \npeace-loving nation. Japan remains unwavering in its commitment to respecting the rule of \nlaw and settling any disputes not through the use of forcible measures but peacefully and \ndiplomatically. At the same time, in order to protect the lives and livelihood of Japanese \nnationals, it is essential to make efforts to “defend our country by ourselves” and increase \ndeterrence. In other words, we need to make the opponent think that “attacking Japan will not \nachieve its goals.”\nJapan’s intentions and tangible measures for achieving them are articulated in our new \nNational Security Strategy, National Defense Strategy, and Defense Buildup Program that \nwere adopted by the Cabinet last December.

We can visualize it as zones of superiority,\nsurrounding one or more units or even the entire force, that are\nshifted as the situation requires. The zones are regions in which we\nmaintain superiority during the full period of our operations by de-\ntecting, identifying, targeting, and neutralizing anything hostile that\nenters or passes through. The battlespace is our base of operations\nthat we position over any area of concern and from which we can\n64\nNDP 1\nproject power. We can establish multiple zones of superiority as spe-\ncific task forces are separated from the main force. All these zones are\nregions into which we receive information and support from outside\nsources, and from which we project power. Theater commanders may\ndirect naval forces to conduct a mission independently if the size of\nthe battlespace they can dominate adequately covers the region of\nconcern. By combining complementary capabilities of units working\ntogether  including the U.S. Army and Air Force, allied, or coalition\ncapabilities in joint or multinational operations  we effectively ex-\ntend the range and geographic influence of our battlespace.\nWhat distinguishes naval forces among armed forces is the\ncombination of operational readiness and agility that creates these\nzones of superiority. These zones, based on the capabilities of our\nsensor and weapon systems, can reach out for hundreds of nautical\nmiles and protect other entities such as convoys, amphibious groups,\nand land masses. We maintain our protective zones of superiority\naround us, establishing them not just upon arrival, but enroute to our\nobjective area. The battlespace moves with the force. By extending\nzones of superiority over landing forces, naval commanders protect\nthose forces while they are accomplishing their missions and establish-\ning their own defensive zones.

In peace-\ntime, the recognized and credible capacity to project power underpins\nour nations ability to influence events, deter potential aggressors,\npromote regional stability, and provide, in conjunction with friends\nand allies, a means of collective security. In war, the capacity to\ndevelop sustained and lethal power rapidly stems from the use of\ncombined arms to generate concentrated offensive power at the time\nand location of our choosing. Combined arms include, but are not\nlimited to: bombs, bullets, missiles; the synergy of sea, ground, and air\nNDP 1\n65\noperations; electronic warfare operations; deception and ruses; psy-\nchological operations; and special warfare operations. The ability to\ntake the fight to the enemy is a strength enjoyed by naval forces and\nhas always been one of our nations primary objectives in war.\nNaval expeditionary forces provide the National Command Au-\nthorities with the operational depth of naval power projection, indepen-\ndently or as part of a joint or multinational operation, by using:\nl Carrier-based Strike Aircraft.

This is best\ndone before the enemys influence can become established, devel-\noped, or expanded. Even if no offensive action is planned, naval\nforces can be used as a credible show of force that can influence a\npotential adversarys actions by providing unequivocal evidence\nthat a fully combat-ready force stands poised to inflict unaccept-\nable losses upon him.\n68\nNDP 1\nForce Sustainment\nUNREP/VERTREP	DEPARTMENT OF THE NAVY\nOFFICE OF THE CHIEF OF NAVAL OPERATIONS\nWASHINGTON, DC 20350-2000\nAND\nHEADQUARTERS UNITED STATES MARINE CORPS\nWASHINGTON, DC 20380-0001
america_Naval_doctrine_60	America	Naval	Sustained naval and joint operations are made possible by a\nlogistic support system that has two major components: fleet-based\nsustainment assets and strategic sustainment assets. Fleet-based\nsustainment assets include replenishment ships of the combat logistics\nforce providing direct fleet support, combat service support units,\nmobile repair facilities, and advanced logistic support hubs. Strategic\nsustainment is provided by air and sea assets that are shared by all\nServices. Successful global response to contingencies depends upon\nour ability to project and sustain U.S. forces in all theaters of opera-\ntions. Integrated support resources in the form of fleet-based\nsustainment assets and strategic assets provide naval expeditionary\nforces and joint and multinational forces the ability to operate in\npeacetime and in war wherever and whenever our national interests\ndemand. Our ability to move and sustain forces at great distances\nfrom our shores is critical to the forward presence component of our\nmilitary strategy.\nNDP 1\n69\nThe same sustainment system that makes it possible for us to\nconduct operations in war also allows our nation to extend its influ-\nence in the form of credible U.S. presence in operations other than\nwar.

We will speed up our efforts to \nimprove their lives, work environments and treatment.\nIn recent years, diplomatic efforts have also gained importance for defense. Since my \nappointment as Minister of Defense, I have held discussions on numerous occasions with \ndefense ministers, including Secretary of Defense Austin of the United States, Japan’s only \nally, and Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Defence Marles of Australia, working to \ndeepen our cooperation and collaboration. Building upon these discussions, we will continue \nto pursue various cooperation, including the joint development of the next-generation fighter \naircraft by Japan, the United Kingdom, and Italy.\nEven if my counterparts and I were to have different views, it is important to make persistent \nefforts to maintain and increase our communication through dialogue, aiming to build trust \nand avoid unforeseen circumstances. As such, I will continue to make these endeavors.\nFrom this perspective, Defense of Japan 2023 outlines the security environment surrounding \nJapan and the activities and efforts of the MOD/SDF. The beginning focuses on the changes \nbefore 2013 (when the previous National Security Strategy was formulated) and the changes \nthrough 2022 (when the current National Security	HAMADA Yasukazu - Minister of Defense 2023

In this \nregard, this white paper has played a critical role. We sincerely hope that Defense of Japan \n2023 will be read by as many people as possible and help increase their understanding of the \nactivities and efforts of the MOD/SDF.\nRussia\nRussia\nChina\nChina\nRussia\nRussia\nRussia\nRussia\nRussia\nChina\nRussia\nRussia\nAn Era of Upheavals:\nAn Era of Upheavals: 10 Years of Change\n 10 Years of Change\n1\n1 The Regional Security Environment Surrounding Japan\nThe Regional Security Environment Surrounding Japan\nJapan is facing the most severe and complex security environment since the end of WWII.

Moreover, Japan has \nentered a new era of crisis, facing its most severe and complex security environment since WWII. To respond to this severe security environment, Japan formulated \nthe National Security Strategy of Japan (NSS), the National Defense Strategy of Japan (NDS), and the Defense Buildup Program (DBP) in December 2022. These are \nthought to mark a major turning point in Japan’s postwar defense policy, enabling the fundamental reinforcement of necessary defense capabilities and creating a \ndefense architecture that can truly protect the people.\nThe NSS is positioned as Japan’s supreme national security policy document. It outlines the Government’s strategy to respond with a whole-of-government \napproach in a wide range of areas including economic security, technology, and intelligence, in addition to the traditional areas of diplomacy and defense. In particular, \nin FY2027, Japan will take the necessary measures to ensure that the budget level for both the fundamental reinforcement of defense capabilities and complementary \ninitiatives reaches 2% of the GDP in FY2022 (approximately 11 trillion yen), in order to reinforce Japan’s own architecture for national defense.\nThe NDS outlines Japan’s defense objectives and its approaches and means by which Japan accomplishes those objectives. In order to defend the lives and \npeaceful livelihood of Japanese nationals amid the most severe and complex security environment since the end of WWII, Japan needs to squarely face the grim reality \nand fundamentally reinforce its defense capabilities, with a focus on opponent capabilities and new ways of warfare (massive	HAMADA Yasukazu - Minister of Defense 2023
japan__doctrine_34	Japan		missile attacks; hybrid warfare, including \ninformation warfare; asymmetrical warfare leveraging the domains of space, cyber and electromagnetic spectrum and with unmanned aerial vehicles and other assets; \nthreats using nuclear weapons, etc.). To this end, the NDS establishes a policy for the fundamental reinforcement of defense capabilities, including the possession of \ncounterstrike capabilities.\nAs for the functions and capabilities required for defense, Japan will first strengthen its (i) stand-off defense capabilities and (ii) integrated air and missile defense \ncapabilities, in order to disrupt and defeat invading forces from a long distance, thereby deterring an invasion of Japan itself. Should deterrence fail, in addition to capabilities \n(i) and (ii), Japan will strengthen its (iii) \nunmanned defense capabilities, (iv) \ncross-domain operation capabilities, \nand \n(v) \ncommand \nand \ncontrol/\nintelligence-related functions, in order \nto ensure asymmetric advantage while \ngaining superiority across domains. \nFurthermore, to operate in a swift as \nwell as persistent manner to crush the \nopponent’s will to invade, Japan will \nalso reinforce its (vi) mobile deployment \ncapabilities/civil protection, as well as \nits (vii) sustainability and resiliency. As \nwhen and how unilateral changes to \nDefense Capabilities To Protect Japan’s Independence, Peace, and Security \nDefense Capabilities To Protect Japan’s Independence, Peace, and Security \b\nPeace and security are essential for Japanese people to live with a sense of safety and for Japan to continue to prosper, but these cannot be secured by simply wishing \nfor them.\nWhat we must prioritize first and foremost is developing proactive diplomacy to protect the lives and livelihood of Japanese nationals. It is essential to promote \nmultilateral cooperation with like-minded countries through the Japan-U.S. Alliance as a cornerstone. At \nthe same time, diplomacy needs to be backed by defense capabilities. As its strategic	HAMADA Yasukazu - Minister of Defense 2023
japan__doctrine_35	Japan		approach, Japan will \nfundamentally reinforce its defense capabilities, including counterstrike capabilities, while developing its \ndiplomacy under the vision of a “Free and Open Indo-Pacific.” Moreover, from the perspective of preventing \nthe emergence of threats to Japan, the importance of the role played by defense capabilities in cooperative \nefforts in the Indo-Pacific region is increasing.\nRecognizing the role of such defense capabilities, Japan will ensure its peace and security by exerting \nefforts in a variety of fields, including diplomacy and economy.\nIn addition, adhering under the Constitution to the basic precepts of maintaining an exclusively \ndefense-oriented policy and not becoming a military power that poses threats to other countries, Japan has \nefficiently built a highly effective, integrated defense force, while firmly maintaining the Japan-U.S. Security \nArrangements, civilian control of the military, and observing the Three Non-Nuclear Principles.\nJapan’s Security and Defense Policy\nBasic Concepts of Japan’s Security and Defense\nChapter 1\nThe National Security Strategy of Japan, the National Defense \nStrategy of Japan, and the Defense Buildup Program, etc.\nChapter \n2\nChapter \n3\nChapter \n4\nⅡ\nPart \nPrime Minister Kishida conducting a review at the International Fleet \nReview\nJapan’s Three Defense Objectives\n(1) Shape a security environment that does not tolerate \nunilateral changes to the status quo by force\n(2) Deter and respond to unilateral changes to the status \nquo by force and such attempts through cooperation \nand collaboration with our ally, like-minded countries \nand others\n(3) Should deterrence fail and an invasion of Japan occur, \ntake primary responsibility to deal with the situation, \nwhile receiving support from our ally and others, to \ndisrupt and defeat the invasion\nPrime Minister Kishida participating in the G7 Summit Meeting \n(May 2023) [Website of the Prime Minister’s Office of Japan]\nBilateral training with U.S. Air Force	HAMADA Yasukazu - Minister of Defense 2023

In addition, further \nefforts will be made by approximately ten years from now to better ensure these defense objectives are met, and to reinforce Japan’s defense capabilities so that any \ninvasion of Japan can be disrupted and defeated earlier and at places further afield.\nIn addition, Japan will also reinforce its defense production and technology bases as virtually integral part of a defense	HAMADA Yasukazu - Minister of Defense 2023

It describes various measures to \nrealize the fundamental reinforcement of defense capabilities at a budget of approximately 43 trillion yen for the next five years, which is on a completely different \nlevel from the past. In particular, Japan will work to fundamentally reinforce areas at the core of its future defense capabilities, such as stand-off defense capabilities \nand unmanned defense capabilities; improve operational rates, secure ammunition, and accelerate investment in fortifying key defense facilities to maximize the use \nof existing equipment; and further reinforce defense production and technology bases and the human resource base.\nBudget for the “First Year” of Fundamentally Reinforcing Defense Capabilities \nBudget for the “First Year” of Fundamentally Reinforcing Defense Capabilities \b\nRegarding defense-related expenditures for FY2023, the MOD has secured a budget appropriate for the content of the first year of the “buildup program” (budget for \nthe “first year” of fundamentally reinforcing defense capabilities), which will build up the initiatives necessary to fundamentally reinforce defense capabilities within \nfive years.\nThe annual budget expenditure includes ¥6,600.1 billion (year-on-year increase of ¥1,421.3 billion (27.4%)) allocated for DBP-related expenditures, an amount \nthat rises to ¥6,821.9 billion when U.S. Force realignment-related expenses are included, with the “substantial increase of the defense budget” having been secured. \nIn addition, future obligation concerning new contracts (new \nprograms) includes ¥7,067.6 billion (2.9 times that of the \nprevious fiscal year) allocated for DBP-related expenditures. \nContracts will be fulfilled in the first fiscal year as much as	HAMADA Yasukazu - Minister of Defense 2023
japan__doctrine_38	Japan		possible so that the necessary equipment can be delivered to \neach unit for operation as expeditiously as possible. Specifically, \nbudgets for areas that constitute the core of Japan’s future \ndefense capabilities, such as “stand-off defense capabilities” \nand “unmanned defense capabilities,” have been significantly \nincreased, while investments aimed at improving operational \nrates, securing ammunition, and enhancing the resiliency of key \ndefense facilities (including the construction of key command \ncenters underground and development of barracks, etc.) \nhave been expedited in order to maximize the use of existing \nequipment.\nIn allocating the budget, programs for the buildup of defense \ncapability that have hitherto been managed by being classified \nunder one of the two categories of “procurement expenditures \nfor major equipment, etc.” and “other expenditures” will now \nbe classified under one of the 15 new categories for each staff \noffice and organization.

To this end, the MOD/\nSDF will urgently possess adequate ammunition as necessary, build up ammunition storage \nfacilities and fuel tanks, and improve equipment availability. In addition, major command \nheadquarters will be moved underground and structurally reinforced, and other facilities \nwill be relocated.\nMeasures for Protection of the Life, Person, and \nMeasures for Protection of the Life, Person, and \nProperty of Japanese Nationals \nProperty of Japanese Nationals \b\nBesides invasions of Japan, large-scale disasters and infectious disease crises are other \nserious threats that require the utmost efforts by the nation to respond.

Japan has maintained its peace, security, and \nindependence centered on the Security Arrangements with the world’s dominant \nmilitary power, the United States, with which it shares basic values such as \ndemocracy, respect for human rights, the rule of law, and a capitalist economy as \nwell as interests in maintaining the peace and security of the world and has strong \neconomic ties.\nThe NDS calls for further deepening of discussions with the United States \non both countries’ respective roles, missions, and capabilities	HAMADA Yasukazu - Minister of Defense 2023
japan__doctrine_45	Japan		to further reinforce \nJapan-U.S. joint deterrence capabilities in an integrated manner from the \nperspective of deterring invasion against Japan. Specifically, Japan will further \ndeepen cooperation with the United States to smoothly implement allied cross-\ndomain operations of the Alliance, including in the domains of space, cyber, and \nelectromagnetic spectrum, and to improve interoperability. Furthermore, Japan will \nreinforce collaboration in such areas as air defense, anti-surface warfare; anti-\nsubmarine warfare; mine warfare; amphibious operations; airborne operations; \nintelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance and targeting (ISRT); protection of assets \nand facilities; and logistics support. In order to effectively realize the division of \nroles and missions between Japan and the United States in light of the fundamental \nreinforcement of Japan’s defense capabilities, Japan will ensure close operational \ncoordination with the United States through Japan-U.S. bilateral planning. In \naddition, Japan will work to improve response capability of the Alliance, including \nreadiness and interoperability of the Alliance, through more advanced and practical \nexercises and training. In order to ensure that the United States extended deterrence \nwith nuclear deterrence at its core remains credible and resilient, Japan will further \nactively engage in and deepen bilateral discussions on extended deterrence, \nincluding those at the ministerial level. To deter unilateral changes to the status \nquo by force and such attempts, as well as to deter various contingencies from \nemerging, Japan will further expand and evolve operations including joint flexible \ndeterrent options (FDO) and joint intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance \n(ISR) activities as a part of routine bilateral efforts by Japan and the United States \non a regular basis.\nIn addition, while the presence of U.S. Forces in Japan (USFJ) functions as \ndeterrence, it is necessary to make efforts appropriate	HAMADA Yasukazu - Minister of Defense 2023

In addition, the development of new technologies \nsuch as artificial intelligence (AI) has expanded the character of warfare not only in the \nground, maritime, and air domains, but also in the space, cyberspace, and electromagnetic \ndomains, including the cognitive dimension. In response to these changes, each country \nis actively engaged in research and development to ensure its technological superiority. \nOn the other hand, Japan’s defense production and technology bases have been exposed \nto challenging conditions resulting from growing issues such as supply chain risks and a \nseries of withdrawals from the industry. In light of these circumstances, the NDS states that \nJapan’s defense production and technology bases are essential infrastructure for securing \nthe stable research and development, production, and procurement of equipment in Japan \nand for incorporating the cutting-edge technologies necessary for new ways of warfare \ninto its defense equipment, making these bases virtually defense capability itself, and that \nefforts will be made to reinforce these bases.\nIn addition, in order to acquire the necessary equipment for new ways of warfare, it \nis imperative for Japan to leverage the technology that it possesses.

In addition, \nactively utilizing technological capabilities developed by Japan’s public and private sectors \nin the area of national security without being held back by existing approaches is an \nessential activity for strengthening Japan’s architecture for national defense. It is important \nto work strategically to ensure technological superiority as a nation by actively leveraging \nthe results of research and development in science and technology in Japan’s public and \nprivate sectors for the research and development of defense equipment.

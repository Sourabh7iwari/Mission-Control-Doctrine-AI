The primary role of the Indian Army is to preserve\nNational interests and safeguard sovereignty, territorial integrity and\nunity of India against external threats and internal subversion by\ndeterrence or by waging war. The primary approach of our Nation is to\nresolve disputes in an amicable manner, with National Objectives being\nachieved through a mix of Politico-Diplomatic initiatives. However, the\nIndian Army will continue to undertake a 360 degree overview of the\nsecurity environment and shall be prepared to prosecute military	India Army

We will fight as we are, at the time and place of our\nchoosing, utilising all resources, after prioritising the options based on\nour capabilities and emerge victorious, while continuing to upgrade our\ncapabilities.\nThis Doctrine provides broad tenets for the prosecution of\noperations by the Indian Army across the entire spectrum of conflict. The\nfocus will be on\nforce modernisation, resource optimisation and\ninnovative conceptual processes leading to winning strategies for future\nwars. Our geostrategic environment, external and internal threats,\npossible responses and a way ahead to develop capabilities for the\nfuture are the major determinants shaping the Land Warfare Doctrine.\nThis doctrine will lay the foundation for formulation of strategies for the	India Army

There is a continuing tendency towards their \nresolution with the use of force, including in regions bordering the Russian Federation. The existing \ninternational security architecture (system) does not ensure equal security for all states. \n11. There is a tendency towards shifting the military risks and military threats to the information \nspace and the internal sphere of the Russian Federation. At the same time, despite the fact that \nunleashing of a large-scale war against the Russian Federation becomes less probable, in a number \nof areas the military risks encountered by the Russian Federation are increasing. \n12. The main external military risks are: \na) build-up of the power potential of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and vesting \nNATO with global functions carried out in violation of the rules of international law, bringing the	President of the Russian Federation

These capabilities enable the joint force to \ngain operational reach and positional advantage.\nAirman’s Perspective\nAir mobility operations are an extension of airpower—the ability to project military \npower through control and exploitation in, from, and through the air. Air mobility \ncontributes to airpower by creating effects at all levels of warfare and breaking down \ngeographical boundaries to apply force rapidly against many facets of an adversary’s \nsources of power. Air mobility’s impact is best understood by connecting the air \nmobility core functions to the USAF functions, joint functions, principles of joint \noperations, and tenets of airpower. Successful air mobility operations depend on the \ntotal force integration of regular and reserve forces, Air Force civilians, and civilian air \ntransportation partners.\nAir Mobility Operations core functions:\nAirlift enables rapid and responsive deployment, sustainment, and redeployment	Official United States Air Force Website - (doctrine.af.mil)

A commander, however, cannot operate\nsolely under the guidance of broad strategy. Neither can he make\nappropriate mission decisions if guided only by tactics and techniques.\nDoctrine guides our actions toward well-defined goals and provides\nthe basis for mutual understanding within and among the Services\nand the national policymakers.

Consequently, naval forces carry their own\nammunition, spares, and consumables  as well as support and repair\nfacilities for use early in a crisis or throughout a protracted conflict.\nThis self-sustainability provides the National Command Authorities\ncritical time to create an environment that will bring success. Our\nships are designed to travel significant distances without replenish-\nment. They carry the striking power of aircraft, guns, missiles, and\nMarine forces that can execute operations ashore immediately, with-\nout an assembly period or a lengthy logistics buildup.

To cover all\npossibilities, the enemy may be forced to spread his defenses too\nwidely, thus exposing vulnerabilities.\nMobility is a key to decisive naval operations. The ability to\nmaneuver ships into position to strike vulnerable targets, or to\nthreaten amphibious assault at multiple locations along an extended\ncoastline, is a significant tactical and operational advantage. After we\nhave launched our strikes, our ships can press the advantage, maneu-\nver out of range, or reposition themselves for the next strike phase. In\namphibious operations, we place troops in a position to attack the\nweakness of the enemy while avoiding his main strength. A landing\nforces ability to maneuver from attack positions over the horizon\nthrough designated penetration points  without a slowdown or loss\nof momentum  could be critical to the success of the landing.

They remain at the heart\nof our force readiness and warfighting effectiveness. As a team, oper-\nating at sea and in the worlds littorals, naval forces are able to shift\nquickly from low-profile, passive, forward-deployed operations to\nhigh-tempo crisis response. In this environment, we are expeditionary\nin character, a force whose readiness, flexibility, self-sustainability, and\nmobility is capable of deterring and, if necessary, winning regional\nbattles, resolving crises, or serving as the naval component of joint\ntask forces to protect our national interests.\n— § — § — § —\nNDP 1	Department of the navy, washington, DC, united states of america

Naval forces accomplish these\nroles through deterrence operations and specific peacetime operations,\nwhile maintaining warfighting readiness through continuing forward\ndeployed presence, exercising a robust sealift capability, and develop-\ning our interoperability with all Services.\nFundamentally, all military forces exist to prepare for and, if	Department of the navy, washington, DC, united states of america

Within\neach specific campaign were a series of important and often decisive\nbattles. At the tactical level, each contributed to the achievement of\nthat campaigns objectives.

The culmination of these campaign objec-\ntives resulted in overall victory in the Pacific theater.\nThe naval contribution in the Pacific in World War II exem-\nplifies all the strategies of campaigning: protection of U.S. ports;\nmaneuver warfare at sea to check the advance of the Japanese Navy;\nsubmarine warfare against Japanese shipping; war at sea to gain con-\ntrol of the sea; and amphibious assault of enemy-held islands, pushing\nthe enemy back and forcing his final unconditional surrender. Cam-\npaigning is not an activity seen only in war. In peace, naval forces\nactively engage in forward presence and peace-support campaigns.\nToday, campaigns range from supporting economic sanctions im-\nposed by United Nations and other international organizations, to\nmaintaining a visible deterrent to regional aggression, and to efforts\nthat stem the flow of illicit drug traffic.\nDeterrence\nIt is our nations policy to deter aggression.

america_Naval_doctrine_39	America	Naval	maintaining a visible deterrent to regional aggression, and to efforts\nthat stem the flow of illicit drug traffic.\nDeterrence\nIt is our nations policy to deter aggression. Deterrence is the\nstate of mind brought about by a credible threat of retaliation, a\nconviction that the action being contemplated cannot succeed, or a\nbelief that the costs of the action will exceed any possible gain. Thus, the\npotential aggressor is reluctant to act for fear of failure, costs, and\nconsequences. The presence of naval forces or their movement to a\ncrisis area are two of the strongest deterrent signals we can send. They\nare unequivocal evidence that a fully combat-ready force stands poised\nto protect our national interests, and that additional force  whatever\nit takes  will be forthcoming. Our naval forces are the leading edge\nof the worlds most capable military, and their well-understood ability\nto project power is a key factor in deterrence.

Chemical or biological weapons are so\nrepulsive to world society that most major countries are signatories to\ninternational treaties banning the production, storage, and use of\nsuch weapons. The United States is a party to these treaties. Yet, chemi-\ncal and biological weapons already exist in many countries and they\nare still proliferating. Our nations continuing involvement with\nfriends, allies, and potential coalition partners is helping to dissuade\nfurther proliferation and buildup of these arsenals. By being able to\ndepend on the strength and commitment of the United States, friendly\nnations should not feel the need to own weapons of mass destruction\nfor their defense.

Our\nnations use or threatened use of our conventional military force in\nthe past has contributed to deterrence by showing national interest,\nresolve, and capability to influence events. Naval forces can move\nrapidly to a specific area to influence political action. In such a show\nof force, we establish credibility by demonstrating our readiness to use\nforce if necessary. A show of force can be particularly effective when\nconducted with allies to prove solidarity and resolve. Limited use of\nforce includes counterterrorist operations, self-defense, retaliatory\nraids, rescue operations, or a direct attack to achieve a specific objective.\nIn this sense, it is the employment of military force by the National\nCommand Authorities without a formal declaration of war.\n20\nNDP 1	Department of the navy, washington, DC, united states of america

Naval presence is more than the day-to-day operation of\nour forces in a forward region. Those operations have crucial signifi-\ncance, but governments, like individuals, react to change.

Forward\ndeployed Navy ships, aircraft, and Marine forces are essential to per-\nmit the United States to act quickly in meeting any crises that affect\nour security. Such a forward presence enables us to support our secu-\nrity interests and is a critical element in encouraging regional stability\nand continuing world confidence in Americas leadership.\nForward presence assures our nation that potential partners\nwill join with us when the time comes.

In addition to assured U.S.\nresponse, an adversary may be deterred from conducting hostile\nactions if he perceives that  regional neighbors will actively oppose\nhim. A strong balance of power in a region can isolate an aggressor.\nOne way to establish this deterrent environment is through coali-\ntions and alliances. Our nation promotes stability throughout the\nworld by establishing supportive relationships with responsible na-\ntions to ensure that the balance of power discourages aggression. In\nthe face of enemy threats, these allies and coalition partners need the\nassurance of knowing they are joining the side that will win.

It conjures visions of classic struggles for\ndominance between battle fleets armed with short-range weapons and\nmaneuvering within sight of each other  relics of a past when the\nmost heavily armed ship was the arbiter of national power. Today, the\naccuracy, lethality, and range of modern weaponry favor the force\nthat first detects its enemy, launches an effective strike, and counters\nincoming weapons. Battles between heavily armed and armored battle\nlines have given way to short, sharp, and usually decisive engagements\nwhich may have been preceded by periods of increasing tension and\nsubstantial diplomatic effort.\n7 The term enabling refers to our ability to respond rapidly to a crisis and take the action	Department of the navy, washington, DC, united states of america

Dominating the enemy at sea\npermits our forces to maintain a forward presence and is the first step\nin establishing our superiority in any region.

Success in engagements at sea demands\npreparation to counter an adversarys gunfire, missiles, torpedoes,\nand mines. Additionally, we must thwart the enemys information\nbase  his capability to control his forces and to locate and target ours\n while enhancing our own. War at sea involves fully integrated\noffensive and defensive tactics that span the subsurface, surface, air,\nspace, and electromagnetic environments.\nIn accomplishing our assigned roles, naval Services prepare to\nfight and win wars. We also play an important role in preventing\nthem. Routine forward presence establishes and maintains regional,\neconomic and political stability and deters aggression.

Our fundamental\nmilitary purpose is to attain national policy objectives through our\ncapacity to wage war successfully. How well we in the Naval Services\naccomplish our mission depends on how thoroughly we understand\nboth the nature and the conduct of war and learn wars many lessons.\nOnly through such understanding can we prepare ourselves for its tests.\nTwo Styles of Warfare\nNaval forces have followed several styles or philosophies of\nwarfare throughout history. Two specific types  attrition and\nmaneuver  have evolved in response to particular needs and force\ncapabilities. Although they vary significantly in efficiency, flexibility,\nand decisiveness, each type of warfare has its own utility, depending	Department of the navy, washington, DC, united states of america

Although they vary significantly in efficiency, flexibility,\nand decisiveness, each type of warfare has its own utility, depending\non circumstances, and both types are conducted today.\n32\nNDP 1\nTHE BATTLE OF THE ATLANTIC\nUsing Attrition Warfare\nIn World War II, allied naval forces engaged in attrition warfare by\nemploying their resources against the German undersea fleet. Analyzing the\neffectiveness of submarine warfare, the former Soviet Union Admiral of the Fleet,\nSergei Gorshkov, noted in his study of this period that German submarines nearly\nended the war through the rapid destruction of the allied merchant fleet. German\nforces, especially U-boats, were credited with sinking more than 2,800 merchant ships\n 68% of all tonnage sunk by Nazi Germany in the war. So devastating was this\nweapon that, at the height of the allied counteroffensive, for each German U-boat,\nthere were 25 U.S. and British warships and 100 aircraft in pursuit. For every German	Department of the navy, washington, DC, united states of america

For every German\nsubmariner at sea, there were 100 American and British antisubmariners. A total of\nsix million men, 5,500 specially constructed ships, and 20,000 small craft were\ndedicated to the antisubmarine war. As the allies pressed their offensive, Germanys\nlosses exceeded its war industrys capacity to keep pace. At the same time, the allies\nwere able to replace their damaged merchant fleet and even expanded it by adding\nreplacements numbering twice the losses suffered. In the Battle of the Atlantic, the\nthreat of the U-boat was checked by overwhelming allied response. This resource-\nintensive, time-consuming effort was an effective use of attrition warfare.\nBattle of the Atlantic\nNDP 1\n33\nAttrition Warfare\nA key difference between attrition warfare  the wearing\ndown of an enemy  and maneuver warfare  a high tempo, indirect	Department of the navy, washington, DC, united states of america
america_Naval_doctrine_69	America	Naval	Battle of the Atlantic\nNDP 1\n33\nAttrition Warfare\nA key difference between attrition warfare  the wearing\ndown of an enemy  and maneuver warfare  a high tempo, indirect\nphilosophy  is our method of engaging the enemy. In the days of\nsail, fleet line tactics were much less involved. Ships in single lines\nexchanged heavy broadsides against an enemy similarly arrayed, all\nwithin sight of each other. Their simple doctrine called for sailing\ndirectly to the enemys location and systematically engaging his fleet.\nAttrition warfare is the application of our strength against an\nenemys strength. It is typically a linear or two-dimensional style of\nfighting that is frequently indecisive and inherently costly in terms of\npersonnel, resources, and time. When success in war on the opera-\ntional and strategic levels depends on our ability to destroy or deny\nthe enemy crucial resources faster than he can recover, we are em-\nploying classic attrition warfare techniques. We attrite the enemy	Department of the navy, washington, DC, united states of america
america_Naval_doctrine_70	America	Naval	the enemy crucial resources faster than he can recover, we are em-\nploying classic attrition warfare techniques. We attrite the enemy\nthrough systematic application of overwhelming force that reduces\nhis ability or capacity to resist.\nManeuver Warfare\nNaval forces also have used the preferable and more effective\n albeit more difficult to master  fighting style known as maneuver\nwarfare. Closely associated with the writings of Sun Tzu and used by\nthe great practitioners of expeditionary, naval, and land war, maneu-\nver warfare is a philosophy, rather than a formula  an approach,\nrather than a recipe. Like attrition warfare, it has long served as com-\nmon doctrine for naval forces. It emphasizes the need to give the\ncommander freedom to deal with specific situations. Maneuver war-\nfare is further characterized by adaptability and is not limited to a\nparticular environment. Though enhanced by a variety of technolo-\ngies, it is not dependent upon any one of them.	Department of the navy, washington, DC, united states of america
america_Naval_doctrine_71	America	Naval	fare is further characterized by adaptability and is not limited to a\nparticular environment. Though enhanced by a variety of technolo-\ngies, it is not dependent upon any one of them.\nManeuver warfare emphasizes the indirect approach  not\nmerely in terms of mobility and spatial movement, but also in terms\nof time and our ability to take action before the enemy can counter\nus. Maneuver warfare requires us to project combat power. Unlike\nattrition warfare, however, this power is focused on key enemy weak-\nnesses and vulnerabilities that allow us to strike the source of his\npower  the key to his existence and strength as a military threat.\n34\nNDP 1\nINCHON - SEOUL\nUsing Maneuver Warfare\n “The Navy and the Marines have never shone\nmore brightly than this morning .”\n— General Douglas MacArthur, 15 September 1950\nThe amphibious operation at Inchon in the Korean War was a\nclassic example of how the naval Services have employed maneuver warfare.

america_Naval_doctrine_72	America	Naval	— General Douglas MacArthur, 15 September 1950\nThe amphibious operation at Inchon in the Korean War was a\nclassic example of how the naval Services have employed maneuver warfare.\nPrior to the operation, the North Korean Peoples Army had driven the\nU.S. and allied forces into a constricted corner of South Korea and\nthreatened to push them from the peninsula altogether. Even though his\nforces were in dire straits, General Douglas MacArthur, Supreme\nCommander of the United Nations forces in Korea, recognized that the\nnaval Services in his command had the ability to reverse dramatically the tide\nof the battle. A landing on the Korean peninsula north of the enemy lines,\nhe reasoned, would allow his forces to sever the critical north/south rail and\nroad supply lines running through nearby Seoul that provided vital support\nto the North Korean siege of the Pusan perimeter. By 15 September 1950,\nU.S. Navy surface combatants and carrier air squadrons, along with shore-	Department of the navy, washington, DC, united states of america

By 15 September 1950,\nU.S. Navy surface combatants and carrier air squadrons, along with shore-\nbased Marine and Air Force air units, had cleared Korean waters and air\nspace of North Korean opposition. Thus protected and concealed from the\nenemy, Vice Admiral Arthur D. Strubles nine-navy, 260-ship, Joint Task\nForce Seven transported Army and South Korean ground units and the\namphibious-trained 1st Marine Division to the strategically important port\nof Inchon, north of enemy lines. These troops stormed ashore via lanes\ncleared of obstructions by naval underwater demolition teams and behind\nthe gunfire of four cruisers, eight destroyers, and the aircraft of six carriers.\nAmphibious support ships soon brought in reinforcements and the supplies\nneeded to maintain and expand the beachhead.

This bold, surprise maneuver\nsevered the lines of communications to 90% of the enemys ground forces\npositioned far to the south opposite the UNs Pusan perimeter. By the end\nof September, faced with entrapment and almost certain destruction, the\nNorth Korean Peoples Army fled the Republic of Korea, a nation they had\ninvaded so eagerly only a few months before.\nNDP 1\n35\nThe Conduct of War\n“Hold the attention of your enemy with a minimum force, then\nquickly strike him suddenly and hard on his flank or rear with\nevery weapon you have.”\n— General A.A. Vandegrift, USMC\nBattle Doctrine for Front Line Leaders, 1944\nSuccess in war often is the result of decisive action that destroys\nthe enemys will or capacity to resist. Because protracted war can cause\nhigh casualties and unwanted political and economic consequences, the\nrapid conclusion of hostilities is a key goal. Maneuver warfare, based on	Department of the navy, washington, DC, united states of america
america_Naval_doctrine_75	America	Naval	high casualties and unwanted political and economic consequences, the\nrapid conclusion of hostilities is a key goal. Maneuver warfare, based on\nthe twin pillars of decisiveness and rapidity, is our preferred style of\nwarfighting. It is as applicable today in the maritime environment as it\nhas been in traditional land warfare. Modern maneuver warfare requires\nintegration and understanding of four key concepts  center of gravity,\ncritical vulnerability, focus of effort, and main effort. We convey these\nconcepts in context to our forces using a mechanism called the\ncommanders intent.\nCenter of Gravity and Critical Vulnerability\nThe center of gravity is something the enemy must have to\ncontinue military operations  a source of his strength, but not nec-\nessarily strong or a strength in itself. There can only be one center of\ngravity. Once identified, we focus all aspects of our military, economic,\ndiplomatic, and political strengths against it. As an example, a lengthy	Department of the navy, washington, DC, united states of america
america_Naval_doctrine_76	America	Naval	gravity. Once identified, we focus all aspects of our military, economic,\ndiplomatic, and political strengths against it. As an example, a lengthy\nresupply line supporting forces engaged at a distance from the home\nfront could be an enemys center of gravity. The resupply line is some-\nthing the enemy must have  a source of strength  but not necessarily\ncapable of protecting itself. Opportunities to access and destroy a cen-\nter of gravity are called critical vulnerabilities. To deliver a decisive blow\nto the enemys center of gravity, we must strike at objectives affecting\nthe center of gravity that are both critical to the enemys ability to fight\nand vulnerable to our offensive actions. If the object of a strike is not\ncritical  essential to the enemys ability to stay in the fight  the best\nresult we can achieve is some reduction in the enemys strength. Simi-\nlarly, if the object of a strike is not vulnerable to attack by our forces,	Department of the navy, washington, DC, united states of america
america_Naval_doctrine_77	America	Naval	result we can achieve is some reduction in the enemys strength. Simi-\nlarly, if the object of a strike is not vulnerable to attack by our forces,\nthen any attempts to seize or destroy it will be futile.\n36\nNDP 1\nYORKTOWN\nExploiting A Critical Vulnerability\nDuring the Revolutionary War, British forces in North America\ndepended on free use of the adjacent seas to move and resupply their\nground troops. This became especially critical to the British ability to\ncontinue fighting in August 1781, on the peninsula between Virginias York\nand James Rivers, when American land forces successfully severed the British\nArmy under General Lord Cornwallis from their ground-based resupply. At\nthis location, British resupply by sea was vulnerable because access to  the\nYorktown port could be denied by controlling entry at the mouth of the\nChesapeake Bay. The French West Indian Fleet under Rear Admiral François\nde Grasse positioned itself at this strategic location in advance of the British	Department of the navy, washington, DC, united states of america
america_Naval_doctrine_78	America	Naval	Chesapeake Bay. The French West Indian Fleet under Rear Admiral François\nde Grasse positioned itself at this strategic location in advance of the British\nfleet. When British Admiral Thomas Graves arrived to support Cornwallis,\nde Grasse maneuvered his ships to engage the enemy outside the bay. His\nactions not only denied Cornwallis his needed support, but permitted\nanother French squadron sailing from Rhode Island to enter the bay and\nreinforce American and French land forces. As a result, the British succumbed\nat Yorktown surrendering their entire Army of 7,600 men. The Franco-\nAmerican alliance was effective in blocking British access to and from the sea\nand thereby exploiting this critical vulnerability. Losing their ability to\nsustain their forces by sea doomed the British war effort in North America.\nBattle of Yorktown Chart\nNDP 1\n37\nThe appearance of critical vulnerabilities depends entirely\nupon the situation and specific objective. Some  such as electrical	Department of the navy, washington, DC, united states of america

Some  such as electrical\npower generation and distribution facilities ashore or the fleet oilers\nsupporting a task group  may be obvious. On a strategic level,\nexamples may include a nations dependence on a certain raw mate-\nrial imported by sea to support its warfighting industry, or its depen-\ndence on a single source of intelligence data as the primary basis for\nits decisions. Alternatively, a critical vulnerability might be an intan-\ngible, such as morale. In any case, we define critical vulnerabilities by\nthe central role they play in maintaining or supporting the enemys\ncenter of gravity and, ultimately, his ability to resist.

The \nfocus here is to fit some of the larger visible pieces, amongst \nthe many missing ones on the broad mosaic of air power \nemployment, as they slowly emerge. The less than expected \ndemonstrated performance of the Russian Army, the unclear \noperational employment concepts of the Air Force and the \nevident dissonance in integration between the two, have led \nsome analysts to lay the blame on the VKS for its inability to \n‘support’ ground operations, and even question the very need \nof an independent Air Force. This is a deeply concerning trend \nof  thought  which  underscores  the  absence  of  a  deeper \nunderstanding of air power in some quarters.\nThe VKS is not ‘missing in action’ as many thought after \nthe sudden decline in tempo from the initial surge operations	Air Marshal Diptendu Choudhury (Retd, India) - vifiinida.org

It  is  currently \nplaying a major offensive role in the new front of Eastern \nUkraine region, carrying out extensive air strikes in the battle \nspaces  of  cities  and  towns.  It  is  attacking  the  Ukrainian \nmilitary,  command  and  control  centres,  fuel  and  weapon \nstorages, power plants, waterworks, and a variety of targets \nin  the  combat  zone.

But  there  is  no  denying  the  fact  that  the  VKS  has \nunderperformed,  and –‘Analysts  have  ascribed  a  variety  of \nreasons  which  range  from  inadequacy  of  precision  guided \nmunitions’ inventory, inability to manage the contested airspace \nbetween Russian Air Force and the SAM (Surface to Air Missile) \nsystems  of  the  Russian  Army,  low  training  standards  of  the \nRussian pilots due to inadequate flying hours, their inability to \nundertake large scale offensive missions, poor Army-Air Force \ncoordination, to the reluctance on part of the VKS leadership to \nengage  in  operations  which  would  lay  bare  their  capability \ngaps.’[1]While these reasons in part or combined have played a \npart  in  the  underperformance,  despite  its  losses  it  has	Air Marshal Diptendu Choudhury (Retd, India) - vifiinida.org

Though  it  is  premature  to  draw  definitive\nconclusions on its operational performance, there are some \ndeeper issues in the mighty Russian military machine which \nhave impacted the prosecution of military operations, and \ntheir war aims.\nThe fundamental orientation and posturing of the Russian \nmilitary over the years, still remains centred on defending its \nheartland and vital industries and cities, using layered and \nintegrated  air  defence.

Inclusion  of  offensive  air  power \namongst  its  multi-layered  conventional  theatre  strike \ncapability showed indications of an offensive shift over the \nlast decade. This was demonstrated in Georgia (2008), Crimea \n(2014) and especially Syria (2015), but in the absence of any \nviable  air  opposition,  the  offensive  use  of  air  power  was \nlimited  in  scale.  While  Russia  has  observed  air  power \nemployment in Western interventions closely over the last \ntwo decades, it is the structural and doctrinal aspects of the \nVKS and its place in the Russian military that remains Army \ncentric. In the Soviet days, the PVO Strany was the dominant \nmilitary air element which owned all AD forces including its \nown aircraft. It was the favoured force as it was central to \nwinning ground campaigns, in comparison to the Russian Air \nForce (VVS) whose role was limited to providing tactical fire	Air Marshal Diptendu Choudhury (Retd, India) - vifiinida.org

It was the favoured force as it was central to \nwinning ground campaigns, in comparison to the Russian Air \nForce (VVS) whose role was limited to providing tactical fire \npower from the air. [2] In 1988 the air assets of the PVO Strany \nwere merged with the VVS and its AD missile element formed \nthe Russian Air Defence Force (VKO). In 2011, the VKO became \nthe Russian Aerospace Defence Force (VVKO) to merge air and \nspace defence. In 2015, Russia merged the VVS and the VVKO \nto form what is now known as the Russian Aerospace Force.\nThe Russian Defence Minister Army General Sergey Shoigu \nhad  then  said  that  the  VKS  was  created  because “their \nformation is dictated by the shift in the centre of gravity of armed  \nstruggle into the aerospace sphere.”  [3]\nThe  VKS  is  organised,  equipped  and  trained  to  repel \nenemy threats, and essentially operates the high-altitude and \nlong-distance  AD  systems  –  the  S-300s  and  S-400s.This	Air Marshal Diptendu Choudhury (Retd, India) - vifiinida.org

The \nRussian  Army  on  the  other  hand  owns  the  battlefield  AD \nsystems which are limited to defending against air attacks at \nthe  low  and  medium  altitudes.  In  a  2019  speech  at  the \nRussian Academy of Military Sciences, the Russian chief of \nGeneral Staff, Valery Gerasimov, described Russia’s military \nstrategy  as  one  of  ‘active  defence.’ [4] This  leads  to  the \nstructural  challenge  for  its  military,  essentially  oriented  to \ndefend the nation against a massive multi-domain threat to \nits  heartland,  in  carrying  out  large  scale  orchestrated \noffensive operations with overwhelming force, which involves \nextensive  participation  of  the  VKS.

All  of  Russia’s  recent \nmilitary operations have been on a much smaller scale, with \nrelatively very little involvement of its aerospace force. The \nlessons learnt in the Georgian campaign in 2008, initiated its \nmilitary  reform  and  modernisation  efforts  which  are  still \nunderway.\nIts strategic exercises - Zapad, Vostok, Tsentsr and Kavkaz \nwere introduced as capstone events of its annual training \ncycle.[5] These  large-scale  exercises  meant  to  showcase  its\noperational art, military strategy and capability in two front \noperations,  nuclear  might,  etc.,  and  serves  as  strategic \ncommunication.

The VKS \nand surface missile units conducted counter-strikes with long \nrange precision guided weapons against the enemy force, \ncommand and control, and key supporting infrastructure, to \nsupport large air assault operations employing helicopters in \ntransport and attack roles, concentrating artillery and rocket \nfire against enemy forces to cause attrition. Russian units \nthen switch to a counteroffensive, with large combined arms \nassault.[6] Typically,  the  VKS  only  supported  the  surface \noperations rather than first create conditions offensively to \ncounter the enemy air, as they have in the Ukraine invasion.\nThe next issue is that, very much like the erstwhile Soviet \ndays  even  today  in  Russia,  aircraft  are  extensions  of  the \nground  force.

russia_Air_doctrine_10	Russia	Air	The next issue is that, very much like the erstwhile Soviet \ndays  even  today  in  Russia,  aircraft  are  extensions  of  the \nground  force.  Combat  aircraft  are  essentially  considered \nairborne  artillery:  inflexible  vehicles  for  the  delivery  of \nmassive firepower. Therefore, the Russian military doctrine \ndoesn’t require the VKS to control large swathes of airspace in \norder  to  pursue  its  operations  towards  surface  campaign \ngoals. Aside from long-range high-altitude AD, the VKS owns \nthe long-range bombers for nuclear and conventional strikes \n(long range aviation), and the military transport fleet. It also \nhas the VVS (frontline aviation or tactical aviation), which till \nonly recently was limited to air operations over the tactical \nbattle areas.

The VVS with its modern four plus generation \nand fifth generation fighters, with a weapon mix of large\nnumber of older generation and some advanced ones, has a \ndefensive  AD  role  against  aerial  threats  and  an  offensive \nstrick role restricted to the surface campaign. Long range air \nlaunched precision and stand-off strikes have only recently \nbeen included in its offensive capability. These enable it to \nengage  targets  deeper  inside  enemy  territory,  which  its \nbombers  cannot  take  on  in  a  dense  AD  environment. \nHelicopters are an important constituent of the military and \nare considered as ground weapons (or ‘tanks in the air’) by the \nRussian General Staff in their operational planning. Since the \nreform,  these  formations  are  known  as  ‘army  aviation \nbrigades’,[7] and  despite  their  high  vulnerability  to  SAMs, \nremain  ‘major  force  multipliers  during  Russian  joint \noperations’.[8] It  is  commanded  by  Army  General  Sergei	Air Marshal Diptendu Choudhury (Retd, India) - vifiinida.org

Hence its doctrine \ndoes not require the VVS to offensively achieve control over \nthe adversarial airspace. Consequently, it is not geared to \ncarry  out  large  scale  offensive  air  operations,  where  all \nelements  of  offensive  counter  air  fighters,  suppression  of \nenemy  AD  (SEAD)  aircraft,  strike  aircraft,  ISR  and  EW \nelements, AD escorts fighters, combine with AWACS and aerial \nrefuellers come together to offensively seize control of the air \nand facilitate the surface campaign.

The initial Russian air and \nmissile  strikes  that  targeted  over  a  dozen  airfields,  the\nUkrainian Air Force (PSU) and its AD systems were extensive. \nIt severely impacted the PSU’s operational capability and its \nlong and medium range AD cover.[9] However, after the initial \nsuccess, Russia failed to follow to put the PSU and its AD out \nof  action.  Total  destruction  is  hard  to  achieve,  unless  the \nmassive and sustained air offensives of the likes of Gulf War \nare  carried  out,  and  where  there  was  practically  no  air \nopposition.  Against  an  adversary  with  a  much  smaller  Air \nForce  (AF),  the  possibility  of  achieving  air  supremacy  (no \ninterference  from  enemy  air)  or  air  superiority  (minimal \ninterference  from  enemy  air)  is  high.

Provided,  there  is \nconcerted effort by the side on the offensive to do so, and its \nAF is given a free hand to execute its air operations against \nthe  adversarial  AF.  Thus,  in  their  effort  to  carry  out  swift \noffensive  operations,  employing  precepts  of  mass  and \nmanoeuvre,  without  having  achieved  a  viable  degree  of \ncontrol of airspace, has led to greater Russian Army and AF \nlosses. According to David Deptula –“Russia has never fully \nappreciated  the  use  of  airpower  beyond  support  to  ground \nforces. As a result, Russia, in all its wars, has never conceived of \nor run a strategic air campaign.”[10]\nThere  have  been  numerous  assessments  of  the \noperational performance of AD and AF on both sides, and \nalmost all have tended to look at them either independently	Air Marshal Diptendu Choudhury (Retd, India) - vifiinida.org

This approach, while it serves to suit the \nnarrative of some and the vested interests of the weapon \nindustries,  may  lead  to  incorrect  and  incomplete  military\nlessons.  Since  even  media  anchors  have  become  ‘military \nexperts’ eager to pronounce ‘breaking news’ analyses, there is \na real danger of looking at the serious and complex business \nof offensive air and AD operations simplistically. Offensive \nemployment of air power is the raison d’être of air forces, and \nair defence is inherently integral to it. They are the con-joined \ntwins of air power as they are not only inter-dependent; they \ncannot do without each other.

The challenge arises when AD \noperations are looked at only from a defensive perspective \nagainst  the  adversary’s  offensive  air  operations,  without \nconsidering the necessity to counter the adversary’s AD to \nprosecute one’s own offensive air operations. Offensive air \npower remains a vital element of a nation’s military power, not \njust towords effectively ‘supporting’ the surface campaign, but \nequally importantly, to take the war deep into the adversarial \nspaces, towards achieving the larger war aim. And therefore, \nfor offensive air power to succeed in both the roles, it has to \ndefeat the adversarial AF. Simply put, AD is a vital element in \nboth offensive and defensive employment of air power, and \ncannot be seen in isolation.\nThe  large  numbers  of  Russian  helicopter  and  fighter \nlosses at low levels have been due to the dated and rigid	Air Marshal Diptendu Choudhury (Retd, India) - vifiinida.org

Having lost \n333 helicopters to the Stinger shoulder fired SAM and Anti-\nAircraft guns in Afghanistan one would have thought there \nwould have been a doctrinal revisit.[11] Interestingly, in the air \noperations  in  2015  where  the  Russian  AF  supported  Syria\nagainst the ISIS, it lost only one fighter to Man Portable AD \nSystem (MANPADS) out its total of 19 aircraft losses, in 34,000 \nsorties over almost two and half years.[12] This was because \nthe VVS, which was deployed independently and was not a \npart of a combined Russian military campaign, conducted its \noperations  from  medium  altitudes  outside  the  MANPADs \nthreat envelope.[13] However, this experience does not appear	Air Marshal Diptendu Choudhury (Retd, India) - vifiinida.org

The VVS \nevidently does not have the freedom to evolve and pursue its \nown  air  doctrine  and  concept  of  operations,  when  it  is \nemployed  as  a  part  of  a  larger  military  whole. \nNotwithstanding doctrinal rigidities, substantial aircraft losses \nwhich includes high end and legacy assets, has forced the VVS \nto shift its fighter operations to the medium altitudes very \nquickly  over  Ukraine.  Helicopter  offensive  operations  over \ncontested airspaces by day have significantly reduced, and \nshifted  into  the  night  where  they  cannot  be  targeted  by \nelectro-optical/infrared MANPADS.

First, \nthe  VVS  still  essentially  remains  a  ‘ground  support’  force, \nwhere  its  focus  was  essentially  centred  on  providing  the \nsurface campaign with aerial fire power, and not ensuring that \nthe  PSU could  not  interfere  with  their  surface  operations. \nThere  have  been  attempts  at  change  from  the  erstwhile \nSoviet AF concepts towards those of modern Air Forces, where\nthe military understanding of air power and independence of \nthe  air  force  to  prosecute  air  operations  is  much  more \nsophisticated,  and  produces  greater  integrated  military \noutcomes.  But  it  in  the  absence  of  any  participation  in \ninternational air exercises with modern air forces, it appears	Air Marshal Diptendu Choudhury (Retd, India) - vifiinida.org

But  it  in  the  absence  of  any  participation  in \ninternational air exercises with modern air forces, it appears \nthat the transformation has been limited to organisational \nrestructuring and superficial changes. There have been no \nindependent  doctrinal  changes  in  its  overarching  VKS  of \nwhich VVS is a part of, as the Russian Army dominant military \ncontinues to adhere to its legacy approach to air power of the \nSoviet era. The second reason is the discernible disconnect in \nthe AD structuring and its employment. The VKS AD centred \non  defending  the  heartland  is  an  Integrated  Air  Defence \nSystem (IADS), which enables what the West calls Anti-Access \nArea-Denial (A2AD).

Its initial stand-off \nstrikes against airfields and AD systems in Ukraine, gave the \nimpression that it was part of an orchestrated counter air and \nSEAD campaign. While it caused serious attrition to Ukraine’s \nAD radars and SAM systems initially, it did not follow through \nby going after its AF. The PSU fighters which were flying blind \nwithout  ground  control  radars  guiding  it  and  without  the \nprotective cover of its long-range SAMs, were vulnerable to \nhigh end Russian fighters armed with Beyond Visual Range \n(BVR) air-air missiles, whose ranges were more than Ukrainian \nBVRs.

Combined  with  the  Russian \nArmy  which  owns  a  variety  of  AD  systems  to  protect  the \nairspace over the battle zones from medium to low altitude \nthreats, also denied the PSU the opportunity to interdict the \nadvancing Russian forces. This was evident when the long \nRussian  armour  columns  and  logistic  convoys  which  were \nforced to use roads due to the ‘Rasputitsa season’,[15] were \nnot engaged by the PSU.

Despite  losing \nmost of its high and medium level AD assets, Ukraine with \nextensive ISR and tactical assistance from its Allies, has been \neffective in employing its surviving mobile AD systems and \nlarge supplies of Western MANPADs.

Deeper  the  surface \ncampaign objective, means greater is the application of air \npower that will be necessary. With Kiev as the initial objective, \nwhere the surface forces would have taken greater time to \nreach, compounded by the mobility challenges of the season, \nalso  meant  more  space  on  ground  and  larger  volume  of \nairspace  would  have  to  be  covered.

Clearly  the  Russian \nmilitary strategy, which did not have a counter air campaign \ncoordinated with SEAD and integrated AD in its play book, \nwas unable to achieve the swift outcomes it expected. The \ndisconnect  between  the  long  range  and  stand-off  missile \nattacks, the initial air operations and the ground campaign\nappears to indicate challenges in the organisational structure, \nevident  in  the  lack  of  coordination  amongst  branches, \nindicating  issues  with  command  and  control,  both  at  the \ntactical and the operational levels. Russian commanders seem \nto have been unprepared for many aspects of the invasion, \nincluding coordination between branches and between units.\n[16] Absence of joint planning, training and execution have \nbeen evident through the campaign, and even necessitated a \nleadership change midway, with General Alexander Dvornikov \ntaking charge.

What could be the problem?\nWay back in 2010, Russian Military Districts (MD) were \nreorganised  into  Operational  Strategic  Commands  (OSKs), \nwhere its frontal and army aviation were transferred from the \nAir Forces to be directly subordinate to Russia’s four new \nOSKs. According to the then Air Force CINC, General-Colonel \nAleksandr Zelin – “The Air Forces will remain a service of the \nArmed  Forces,  its  Main  Command  (Glavkomat)  will  continue \nfunctioning,  the  transfer  of  four  Air  Forces  and  Air  Defense \ncommands to the commanders of the new military districts - \nWestern,  Southern,  Central  and  Eastern.”  This  was  –“just  to \noptimize command and control and concentrate the main forces \nand means in the troops (OSK).” The new system of command \nand control was ostensibly created due to ‘the realities of the	Air Marshal Diptendu Choudhury (Retd, India) - vifiinida.org

Western  experts  echo  this  view. ‘Instead  of \nworking  to  control  the  skies,  Russia’s  air  force  has  mostly	Air Marshal Diptendu Choudhury (Retd, India) - vifiinida.org

Focusing on ground \ntroops can work if you have almost endless numbers of soldiers  \nand are prepared to lose them. But so wedded is Russia to its \nhistory of successes on the ground that it fails to understand the \nimportance of airpower.’[19]\nThough the focus has been on the larger pieces of the \nunderperformance  of  the  Russian  air  power,  two  aspects \nwhich  have  rightfully  earned  their  place  in  contemporary \nwarfare  –  MANPADS  and  drones,  need  a  mention  here. \nWithout  taking  away  anything  from  the  demonstrated \nlethality of these two weapon systems, the hype of their role \nbeing a ‘game changer’ in warfare, where the future manned	Air Marshal Diptendu Choudhury (Retd, India) - vifiinida.org

But \nthose are deeper operational, tactical and technical aspects \nand including use of drones and MANPADS amongst many\nother  vital  aspects  like  EW,  secure  and  encrypted \ncommunications, advanced weaponry, etc. But for now, one \ncannot overlook from wider standpoint that despite the losses \nand inefficient use of air power, the VKS has contributed much \nto the war despite the shifting war aims.

For Russia, the United States is \n“enemy number one” due to its aspiration to dominate the oceans, which \nincludes achieving the uncontested hegemony of its Navy and restricting access \nto ocean resources and communications. But NATO's infrastructure approaches \n"our borders, the increase in Western naval maneuvers and the territorial claims \nof islands and coastal areas that belong to us" are also a challenge. In particular, \nPutin said he is especially concerned about the Western tactic of "weakening \nour control of the Arctic route" that he proposes as an alternative to the Suez	Rosendo Fraga - Director of CARI’s Foreign Relations and Armed Forces Committee
russia_Naval_doctrine_1	Russia	Naval	Putin said he is especially concerned about the Western tactic of "weakening \nour control of the Arctic route" that he proposes as an alternative to the Suez \nCanal. Due to the above, "we will accelerate and diversify activities in waters \nfrom the archipelagos of Novaya Zemlya, Franz Joseph Land and Svalbard (of \nNorwegian sovereignty), to the Wrangel Island". One of Russia's priorities is to \nbecome one of the leaders in exploration and exploitation of the resources of the \nArctic territory, especially the continental shelf, to which other countries, such \nas the United States, Canada and the Scandinavians, also aspire. \n \nThe Russian plan assumes the creation of naval bases in various parts of the \nworld to ensure navigation as a global power. Bases and supply points will be \nestablished from the Eastern Mediterranean to the Asia-Pacific region, the \nIndian Ocean and the Persian Gulf. It also considers to advance with the	Rosendo Fraga - Director of CARI’s Foreign Relations and Armed Forces Committee

In the case of the Mediterranean, the \nmain risk is the lack of sufficient bases outside Russia's borders, which can \nreceive and supply its ships and carry out repair and technical maintenance \ntasks. Russia ratified its permanent presence in the Port of Tartous, in Syria, \nwhile it will open maintenance centers in "territories of other countries in the \nregion, including Africa and the Middle East."\nSpecifically, it aims to increase cooperation with India, Iran, Saudi Arabia and \nIraq, with a view to having strategic alternatives to its traditional partners on the \nEuropean continent. It should be noted that Russia is the largest country in the	Rosendo Fraga - Director of CARI’s Foreign Relations and Armed Forces Committee

It should be noted that Russia is the largest country in the \nworld and has approximately 40,000 kilometers of coastline. In this framework, \nthe mobilization of the Navy's resources includes civilian ships, their crews, and \nthe use of civilian maritime facilities in times of war. It should be remembered \nthat the Russian Navy in 2001 abandoned its base in Cuba and in 2004 the one it \nhad in Vietnam. But once Putin asserted himself in power, the Russian Navy \nresumed its patrols around the world from 2008, including areas under NATO's \nresponsibility. \n \nIn terms of weapons, the great novelty was the Zircon hypersonic missile, which \ngives the Russian Navy a global offensive capacity. This missile allows to \nrespond to any naval attack.

They have a range of 1,000 kilometers and belong \nto a new family of weapons that Putin describes as "invincible" and that have \nbeen in development since October 2020. According to the Russian president, \nthe Admiral Gorshkov frigate will be the first ship in the fleet to receive these \nmissiles. He said that "the deployment area of this ship will be chosen in \naccordance with Russia's security interests." In Saint Petersburg, Putin presided \nover a naval parade in the Gulf of Finland (a country that has recently asked to \njoin NATO), in which 40 ships (submarines and speedboats), 42 naval aircraft \nand more than 3,500 troops participated. \n \nPutin was accompanied by Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and Navy Chief \nAdmiral Nikolai Yevmenov. Parades were also held in other ports due to the \ndate and the one in Kaliningrad, the Russian stronghold on the Baltic, acquired \nspecial significance.

But on July 31, a Ukrainian drone fell on the Russian \nNaval Command at the Sevastopol base in Crimea, where the Black Sea \nCommand is located, forcing the suspension of events in this city. Since the \nbeginning of the invasion on February 24, the Russian fleet has played an active \nrole in missile attacks on Ukrainian territory, but has suffered significant losses, \nsuch as the most important ship in the Black Sea fleet. \n \nTo a large extent, the new doctrine is an update of that put forth by Czar Peter \nthe Great in the early 18th century, when Russia began its push westward. \nAccording to this Tsar, Russia was the power of the Five Seas: Black, Azov, \nCaspian, Baltic and Arctic. Three centuries later, the decree signed by the\nPresident in St. Petersburg on the occasion of the Navy Day asserts that "our	Rosendo Fraga - Director of CARI’s Foreign Relations and Armed Forces Committee

Three centuries later, the decree signed by the\nPresident in St. Petersburg on the occasion of the Navy Day asserts that "our \ninterests extend to all oceans and the Caspian Sea." It also warns that Moscow \ndoes not accept interference in its affairs in the aforementioned areas nor "in the \nSea of Okhotsk (Pacific), Azov (grabbed from Ukraine), the Kuril Islands \n(whose sovereignty Japan claims) and the straits that lead to Asia and Africa". \nThe new doctrine points out that “we have marked the borders, both economic \nand strategic. We will guarantee their defense firmly and by all means.” \n \nAt the same time, he warns that "the key is the ability of our Navy to respond \nlike lightning to all those who decide to threaten us." According to the decree, \nthe Kremlin relies on diplomatic instruments to resolve disputes, but warned \nthat it can resort to force "if necessary." Putin did not mention the Ukraine war	Rosendo Fraga - Director of CARI’s Foreign Relations and Armed Forces Committee

Putin did not mention the Ukraine war \nin his brief speech, but said the new doctrine advocates a "complete \nstrengthening of Russia's geopolitical position in the Black and Azov seas." \n \nIn conclusion: in the new vision for the Russian Navy, announced by Putin on \nJuly 31, the United States is considered the main threat along with the \nexpansion of NATO's infrastructure. The document states that Russia needs to \nhave supply and technical maintenance bases in all oceans: the Pacific, the \nAtlantic, the Indian, the Persian Gulf and the Arctic. The novelty in terms of \nweapons was the announcement of the Zircon hypersonic missile, which \nconsiderably expands the offensive capacity of the Russian Navy.

Doctrinal \ndevelopments do not emerge from a vacuum, and are best understood from both a \ncultural and organizational perspective.

Section one focuses on the essence of the \nmaritime doctrine itself, as well as on the complex institutional setting which \nprovides its backdrop. The document’s lofty ambitions, when juxtaposed with the \nstudy of current realities, suggest that it may be more advocatory and aspirational \nthan genuinely reflective of reality. The second section ventures that India’s naval \nthought can best be understood as syncretic, with a variety of traditions shaping \nthe service’s vision and evolution.\nFour different traditions or schools of thought are identified:\n•\t\nThe Indian Continentalist School: more inward than outward-looking, and \nwhich has seldom let maritime issues seep through the mental barrier of \nthe Himalayas.\n•\t\nThe Raj Pan-Oceanic School: developed at the height of the British Empire	Iskander Rehman - Senior Political Scientist · RAND

Some of the former chapters, \nsuch as those outlining the ‘concepts of maritime power’, or ‘India’s maritime \nenvironment and interests’ have been revamped somewhat, and an entirely new \nchapter on ‘Naval Combat Power’ has been added. This chapter, however, remains \nin the same abstract and didactic mould as most of those preceding it, merely \noutlining in half a dozen pages the fact that naval combat power comprises three \nelements: conceptual, physical and human, and listing different categories of \nvessels.

Tactical issues have been deliberately kept outside the purview \nof this doctrine, as several other naval publications comprehensively address these \naspects’.15 This self-carved doctrine, moulded from a professedly higher strategic \nlevel, and which merely skims tactical issues rather than directly addressing them, \nis key to understanding what distinguishes the Navy from the other branches of the \nIndian Armed Forces. Indeed, the Navy views itself as being a multidimensional \nservice, capable of taking on many roles, of which warfighting is but one aspect.\nThis is reflected in the most absorbing section of the maritime doctrine, which \nlays out four roles for the Indian Navy: military, diplomatic, constabulary and \nbenign. These four roles echo to a certain degree those already identified more \nthan 10 years prior in the Indian Navy’s first Strategic Defence Review, which	Iskander Rehman - Senior Political Scientist · RAND

These four roles echo to a certain degree those already identified more \nthan 10 years prior in the Indian Navy’s first Strategic Defence Review, which \nwere then defined as the following: sea-based deterrence, economic and energy \nsecurity, forward presence and naval diplomacy.16\nTwo important elements are worth noting, however. First, what was defined \nas naval diplomacy in 1998 has been split into two different roles – benign and \ndiplomatic – in 2009. The Indian Navy has long recognized the potential offered \nby vessels in terms of diplomacy and soft power projection. This has been reflected \nboth in words, via the earlier version of the maritime doctrine, which defined the \nNavy as an ‘effective instrument of India’s foreign policy by generating goodwill \nthrough maritime diplomacy’;17 and in actions, as over the past decade the Indian \nNavy has frequently displayed with a certain panache its desire and capacity to	Iskander Rehman - Senior Political Scientist · RAND

Indian ships \nhave thus taken part in a wide range of humanitarian and disaster relief operations \nover the years, whether it be in the wake of the devastating 2004 tsunami, or in \n2008 after the Nargis cyclone. India has also engaged in NEOs or Non-Combatant \nEvacuation Operations, such as in 2006, when four Indian warships successfully \nevacuated more than 2,000 Indian, Sri Lankan and Nepalese citizens from a war-torn \nLebanon. Interestingly, NEOs are classified as being a form of ‘maritime mission \nand support’, thus falling under the Navy’s diplomatic, rather than its benign role, \nin the 2009 doctrine.

And yet, as retired naval officer Ashok \nSawhney recently highlighted, the Navy’s capital budget, that is, the portion of the \nbudget devoted to funding new acquisitions, amounted in 2009 to 2.5 billion dollars \nout of a total of 4 billion.54 This amount, notes Sawhney, remains very modest	Iskander Rehman - Senior Political Scientist · RAND

Although \nthe Navy’s overall budget will continue to expand in nominal terms due to the \noverall increase in the defence budget enabled by India’s sustained GDP growth, \nit will be hard pressed to fulfil the terms set out in its own doctrine if it does not \nreceive a more generous allocation.

In each case, there is little chance of\nstriking a decisive blow unless such an enemy can be forced to expose\none or more of his critical vulnerabilities. One way of doing this is to\nexploit the dynamics of warfighting by maintaining a high tempo.\nTempo is the pace of action  the rate at which we drive events. A\nrapid tempo requires that commanders be provided timely, accurate\nintelligence to find enemy weaknesses, enough decentralization to\nallow subordinate commanders to exploit opportunities, and clearly\nunderstood and well-rehearsed procedures at the lowest levels.\nNDP 1\n41\nThe decision cycle is a vital aspect of tempo.

Directed against an enemy with a slower decision cycle, a series\nof rapid and unexpected attacks on critical vulnerabilities can be\noverwhelming, depriving him of his power to react effectively and\nultimately destroying his center of gravity.\nAs in the martial art of judo, the objective in fighting with\na high tempo is to take action that sets in motion a series of\nactions and reactions, each of which potentially exposes  if only\nfor a brief time  a critical vulnerability. In such a contest, we\nachieve victory by making the most rapid and unpredictable moves\nspecifically selected to catch the enemy in a vulnerable position\nlong enough to deliver a decisive blow. It is an aggressive style of\nwarfare in which we gain advantage by observing the enemy, ori-\nenting ourselves to these surroundings, deciding on a move, and\nacting more rapidly than the enemy.

These important lessons emphasize its nature and form the\nbasis for our warfighting doctrine.\nThe Principles of War\nAn important issue throughout military history has been the way\na military organization addresses the qualities that war demands from its\nparticipants. Military leadership has dealt best with the intractable prob-\nlems of war as a form of military and naval art. In the maritime environ-\nment, with its distinctive factors, we fight using the principles that apply\nto combat everywhere. Wisdom gained from study of the basic principles\nof war underscores that war is not the business of managers with check-\nlists; it is the art of leaders.\n9  Nine principles of war are discussed in such authoritative publications as Joint Publication\n0-1 Basic National Defense Doctrine, Joint Publication 1 Joint Warfare of the U.S.\nArmed Forces, FM 100-5 Operations, and FMFM 1 Warfighting.\n44\nNDP 1	Department of the navy, washington, DC, united states of america

Direct every military operation toward a clearly\ndefined, decisive, and attainable objective. The naval Services\nfocus their operations to achieve political purposes defined by\nthe National Command Authorities. With national strategic\npurpose identified, we can select theater military objectives\nand form operational and tactical objectives based on specific\nmissions and capabilities. Whether the objective is destroying\nan enemys armed forces or merely disrupting his ability to\nuse his forces effectively, the most significant preparation a\ncommander can make is to express clearly the objective of the\noperation to subordinate commanders.\n l Mass.

A force, even one smaller\nthan its adversary, can achieve decisive results when it concen-\ntrates or focuses its assets on defeating an enemys critical\nvulnerability.

Nimitz assigned Rear Admiral Frank Jack Fletcher, a veteran of battle\nwho had recently faced Japanese carrier forces at Coral Sea, as the officer in\ntactical command. Nimitzs objectives were clear and simple: hold Midway\nand inflict maximum damage on the enemy by strong attrition tactics. Nimitz\nfurther added In carrying out the task assigned . . . you will be guided by the\nprinciples of calculated risk. Fletcher had unity of command and broad\nlatitude in executing his tasks. He directed Rear Admiral Raymond A. Spruance,\n        Fletcher\n     Spruance\nCommander Task Force 16, to attack the enemy carriers as soon as the ships\nwere located.

By the time Japanese\nreconnaissance aircraft did discover the presence of the American force, it\nwas too late.

Naval training does\nnot seek to turn Marines into capable Sailors, nor does it seek to\nprepare those who operate our ships to land across a beach; but within\nlimits, training is fundamental to achieving unity of effort.

Pro-\nfessional military education focuses on the science and art of\nwarfighting. Such art challenges the professional to analyze, reaffirm,\nand perhaps rethink truths; to seek innovations through new and\nvaried application of conventional guidance that has been successful\nin the past; and to recognize the cases when the paths taken in history\nno longer apply. Education refines our ability to see more than the\nfinal statistics of a conflict or operation. It enables us to see wars\nlessons and the thinking of its masters, as well. The refined tools of\neducation may be provided by the experience of instructors in an\nacademic environment, but can be advanced only by individual com-\nmitment and self-discipline.\n54\nNDP 1	Department of the navy, washington, DC, united states of america

It is based on the commanders preparation\nof the battlespace,11 a formal evaluation, supported by intelligence,\nthat integrates enemy doctrine with such factors as physical and en-\nvironmental conditions. From this evaluation, the commander iden-\ntifies the forces and support needed to execute the plan within a	Department of the navy, washington, DC, united states of america

Naval forces operation plans are integrated\ninto the complete inventory available to the Joint Force Commander.\nFor execution, plans become operation orders. Operation plans in-\nclude: the theater strategy or general concept and the organizational\nrelationships; the logistics plan shows ways the force will be supported;\nand the deployment plan sequences the movement of the force and its\nlogistical support into the theater. Elements of planning that produce\na concept of operations include the commanders estimate, deciding\npossible courses of action, preparation of the mission statement and\nits execution strategy, situation analysis, and formulation of the\ncommanders intent. These elements are applicable up, down, and\nacross chains of command.\nEffective deliberate and crisis-action planning is essential and	Department of the navy, washington, DC, united states of america

These elements are applicable up, down, and\nacross chains of command.\nEffective deliberate and crisis-action planning is essential and\nshould be complementary at all levels in the chain of command.

In a naval context, we use battlespace to mean analysis of the physical and environmen-\ntal characteristics of a geographic area and its effects on our ability to establish superiority in\nevery dimension of this space.

This is especially true when we employ high-tempo\noperations characteristic in maneuver warfare. High tempo involves\nrisks when all possible information is not available at the time deci-\nsions must be made and executed. We are sometimes placed in a posi-\ntion of weighing certainty in outcome against the benefits of taking\nprompt action. We have seen how prompt, decisive action can have\nsignificant advantages in keeping ahead of the enemys decision-and-\naction cycle. The risk of uncertainty in our decisions must be balanced	Department of the navy, washington, DC, united states of america
america_Naval_doctrine_121	America	Naval	significant advantages in keeping ahead of the enemys decision-and-\naction cycle. The risk of uncertainty in our decisions must be balanced\nby the gains of striking during a fleeting window of opportunity. Every\ncommander can expect to be faced with accepting a certain level of risk\nin conflict. We assess risk to the overall mission and to the individuals\ninvolved in the task continuously during execution as well as during\nformal advanced planning.\nRisk management and risk assessment are formal, essential\ntools of operational planning. Sound decisionmaking requires the use\nof these tools both in battle and in training. Naval commanders\nevaluate risk by using combinations of real-time, deliberate, and in-\ndepth assessments to determine the cumulative effect on the mission\nand seek ways to eliminate or control unnecessary hazards to their\nforces. Go/No-Go criteria are one form of evaluating our tolerance\nto risk. A mission may not be initiated, for example, if the base of	Department of the navy, washington, DC, united states of america

A mission may not be initiated, for example, if the base of\noperations is in jeopardy or would be unprotected when the force\ndeparted. Because risk is often related to gain, leaders weigh the risks\nagainst the benefits to be obtained from an operation, recognizing\nthat unnecessary risk can be as great a hindrance to mission success\nas enemy action. On the other hand, carefully identifying the risks,\nanalyzing and controlling as many factors as possible, and executing\na supervised plan that accounts for these factors have contributed to\nthe success of some of the greatest military operations in history.\n56\nNDP 1\nNORMANDY\nAccounting for Risk in Warfare\nAn excellent application of risk assessment and risk management is\nillustrated in the largest amphibious operation ever conducted  the Allied\nlanding at Normandy, June 6, 1944.

Operation Overlord was one of the\nmost intricately planned invasions in history. One uncertainty however, the\nweather, threatened its success. General Dwight Eisenhower, the Supreme\nCommander, Allied Expeditionary Forces, recognized that high winds, low\nclouds, and heavy seas converging in the objective area presented\nunacceptable risk to his forces. He therefore delayed the operation, despite\nthe realization that this might upset the precise timing of the enormous\nmilitary undertaking. Carefully monitoring the situation,  Eisenhower\nsought a balance where the advantage of attacking under adverse physical\nconditions, which might surprise the enemy not expecting him to take this\nrisk, would offset the hazards associated with the poor weather itself.

After\n24 hours the weather had only moderately improved, but Eisenhower felt he\nhad found that balance. With the risk now warranted, he made his irrevocable\ndecision, launching a force of more than 5,000 vessels, 11,000 aircraft, and\n700,000 men, in one of the most significant joint and multinational\noperations of the war.\nNormandy Landing\nNDP 1\n57\nHow well we fight depends upon how we think about fighting.\nOur thinking is shaped and reinforced by a continuing professional\nmilitary training and education process drawing upon:\nl Sound military doctrine  the framework and\nphilosophy for our approach to fighting, which comple-\nments the principles of war.\nl The principles of war  precepts developed from\nexperience that, when applied with judgment, have led\nto success.\nl Planning  formal, detailed analysis of options and\ncontingencies for known situations.

We can visualize it as zones of superiority,\nsurrounding one or more units or even the entire force, that are\nshifted as the situation requires. The zones are regions in which we\nmaintain superiority during the full period of our operations by de-\ntecting, identifying, targeting, and neutralizing anything hostile that\nenters or passes through.

Theater commanders may\ndirect naval forces to conduct a mission independently if the size of\nthe battlespace they can dominate adequately covers the region of\nconcern. By combining complementary capabilities of units working\ntogether  including the U.S. Army and Air Force, allied, or coalition\ncapabilities in joint or multinational operations  we effectively ex-\ntend the range and geographic influence of our battlespace.\nWhat distinguishes naval forces among armed forces is the\ncombination of operational readiness and agility that creates these\nzones of superiority. These zones, based on the capabilities of our\nsensor and weapon systems, can reach out for hundreds of nautical\nmiles and protect other entities such as convoys, amphibious groups,\nand land masses.

The battlespace moves with the force. By extending\nzones of superiority over landing forces, naval commanders protect\nthose forces while they are accomplishing their missions and establish-\ning their own defensive zones. This concept applies both in war and\nin operations other than war.\nPower Projection\nOur ability to project high-intensity power from the sea is the\ncornerstone of effective deterrence, crisis response, and war. In peace-\ntime, the recognized and credible capacity to project power underpins\nour nations ability to influence events, deter potential aggressors,\npromote regional stability, and provide, in conjunction with friends\nand allies, a means of collective security.

In war, the capacity to\ndevelop sustained and lethal power rapidly stems from the use of\ncombined arms to generate concentrated offensive power at the time\nand location of our choosing. Combined arms include, but are not\nlimited to: bombs, bullets, missiles; the synergy of sea, ground, and air\nNDP 1\n65\noperations; electronic warfare operations; deception and ruses; psy-\nchological operations; and special warfare operations.

China adopted de-\nfensive military doctrines that envisaged total \nwar during the Cold War. This trend has started \nto change as China has become more powerful \nsince the end of the Cold War. The Chinese mili-\ntary’s doctrinal innovation keeps up with China’s \ndiversifying interests and growing capacity. In \nthe imagination of the Chinese military, the cen-\ntral theater of war has significantly moved from \nChina’s mainland (i.e. territorial domain) to \nChina’s periphery (more emphasis on the mari-\ntime domain). Since the end of the Cold War, \nChina has also abandoned its decades-old total \nwar doctrine by embracing a limited war doc-\ntrine, which is more suitable for its new political \naims.

Second, though China is a major power \nin North and Southeast Asia, the time is not yet \nripe for it to be a global military power that can \nproject its military capability beyond its nearby \nseas. China’s most recent military doctrines are \ndesigned to deal with local challenges. The names \nof these doctrines reflect its concerns about local \nwars as well. This implies that China does not \nhave global strategic interests to defend through \nwar. China continues to expand and promote its\n9\ns e t a v . o r g\nCHINA’S EVOLVING MILITARY DOCTRINE AFTER THE COLD WAR\neconomic interests globally. However, the Chi-\nnese military still does not feel that China will be \ninvolved in a global maritime or territorial war, \ncontrary to what many studies suggest under the \nconcept of the “China threat.” A clear implica-\ntion of this is that when its interests in Africa, for \nexample, are at stake, it is less likely that China	setav.org, Turkey

Since \nthe Chinese military has not developed a suitable \ndoctrine, such a military confrontation would be \nstrategically futile for China.\nIt is also important to note that this study \ndoes not examine the potential implications \nof a conflict between China and the United \nStates. Such a conflict would likely involve \nnuclear weapons, which are out of the scope \nof this study. The extent to which China’s con-\nventional and nuclear doctrines are coupled \nshould be discussed in a broader study, as it \nis important to understand under what condi-\ntions China will resort to nuclear weapons in a \npotential conflict.2\nThe study proceeds as follows: The next sec-\ntion outlines the concept of military doctrine \nand its key features.

Barry Posen, The Sources of Military Doctrine, (Cornell University \nPress, Ithaca: 1984), p. 13.\nMilitary doctrine is essentially about integrat-\ning military means to the political ends at the \ngrand strategic level. For a broader definition, \nOwen Cote Jr. describes military doctrine as a \n“set of tools, people, and beliefs about how to \nemploy them in battle that the major organi-\nzational elements of the military develop as a \nguide to fighting wars.”4 Barry Posen, on the \nother hand, notes that two questions are impor-\ntant about military doctrine: What means shall \nbe employed? How shall they be employed?5 A \nmilitary doctrine is a state’s response to these \nquestions. In short, a military doctrine is a \nstate’s theory about how to fight wars.\nThe formulation of a military doctrine \ncould be thought of as a two-level process. \nStates first assess the international environment \nin order to have an idea about how threats and \nopportunities are distributed in the system.

For \nexample, states evaluate geographic factors, \nstate-of-the-art military technology, rising and \ndeclining powers, and the military capabilities \nof their neighbors. After such an assessment, \nstates turn back to see how their military or-\nganizations look like. At this point, they ana-\nlyze what is necessary and possible for their \nmilitaries.6 After this process, states formulate \ntheir military doctrines. However, this does not \nnecessarily imply that states implement this \nprocess formally and even deliberately. The for-\nmulation of military doctrines is sometimes a \nresult of an informal process. Moreover, states \nusually do not publish their military doctrines. \nThus, military exercises, available field manu-\nals, and force structure are important sources \nfor analyzing military doctrine.	setav.org, Turkey

Although there \nare various, even contradictory, definitions of in-\nnovative military doctrines, Adam Grissom argues \nthat there is a “tacit” consensus in the literature.8 \nAccordingly, this consensus has three dimensions. \nFirst, military innovations change the manner in \nwhich military organizations function in the field. \nSecond, military innovations are significant in \nscope and impact. Third, military innovations are \nexpected to increase military effectiveness.9 \nAs mentioned above, military doctrine may \naffect the stability of international politics as it \nprovides information –if not perfect– about the \nintentions and, more importantly, the capabili-\nties of states.

With this doctrine, China \nadopted a theory of victory not only in its terri-\ntory but also in its periphery.

CHINA’S NAVAL CAPACITY (2005-2019)\nSource: China Naval Modernization: Implications for U.S. Navy Capabilities - Background and Issues for Congress, Congressional Research Service \nReport, September 24, 2019. \nCONCLUSION\nThis study has shown that as its power increases, \nChina’s military doctrine has evolved in line with \nthe expansion of its political goals at interna-\ntional and regional levels. China’s military doc-\ntrine has evolved from a sheer defensive stance \nenvisaging a total war to a more offensive stance \nenvisaging limited war in the periphery.\nChina’s military innovation is often both a \nresponse to the changing international environ-\nment and a function of its increasing power.

Ac-\ncordingly, with the decline of the Soviet Union \nand the concomitant reform process initiated by \nDeng Xiaoping, China found a strategic oppor-\ntunity to modernize its military. This brought its \nfirst major innovation during the late Cold War \nperiod: the 1980 doctrine. However, China’s most \nradical military innovation came in 1993. The \ncollapse of the Soviet Union and the Gulf War \npushed the Chinese elites to change the military \ndoctrine of the time. The technological superior-\nity of the U.S. military in the Gulf War forced \nChina to modernize its military into a more tech-\nnology- and information-reliant organization. \nThe subsequent military doctrinal changes (i.e. \nthe 2004 and 2014 doctrines) did not present ma-\njor changes compared to the 1993 doctrine.

The \nthree doctrines adopted after the Cold War show \nthat China is still far from conducting global op-\nerations, but is focused on a local war - one that \ninvolves Taiwan and probably the United States. \nThe content of the recent doctrines also suggests \nthat China is increasingly preparing for winning \nlocal wars by conducting offensive operations.\n216\n221\n222\n233\n262\n276\n276\n271\n273\n283\n294\n303\n317\n306\n335\n0\n50\n100\n150\n200\n250\n300\n350\n400\n2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019\nANKARA   •   İSTANBUL   •   WASHINGTON D.C.   •   CAIRO   •   BERLIN   •   BRUSSELS\nThis study examines China’s conventional military doctrine and its evolution \nafter the Cold War.

china_Military_doctrine_44	China	Military	This study examines China’s conventional military doctrine and its evolution \nafter the Cold War. If its current economic rise continues, China’s strategic \nposture and approach to war will be one of the key variables of international \npolitics. To make sense of China’s current foreign policy stance and potential \nfuture behavior regarding war, the following questions need to be answered: \nWhat military means, if necessary, would China employ in case of a war? \nWhere is a military threat to China likely to come from? What are the strate-\ngically important battle spaces for China? How does China plan to use mili-\ntary means in those domains? \nMilitary doctrines stand as reliable and useful sources to answer these ques-\ntions. Regarding China’s military doctrine, this study proposes two interre-\nlated arguments. First, as its power has increased, the evolution of China’s \nmilitary doctrine proves that China has adopted a more assertive and active	setav.org, Turkey

First, as its power has increased, the evolution of China’s \nmilitary doctrine proves that China has adopted a more assertive and active \nstance on issues and regions. The Chinese military’s doctrinal innovation \nkeeps up with China’s diversifying interests and growing capacity. Second, \nthough China is a major power in North and Southeast Asia, the time is not \nyet ripe for it to be a global military power that can project its military ca-\npability beyond the nearby seas. China’s most recent military doctrines are \ndesigned to deal with local challenges. This implies that the Chinese military \nstill does not feel that the country is likely to fight a global maritime or ter-\nritorial war in the near future.\nBEKİR İLHAN\nCHINA’S EVOLVING  \nMILITARY DOCTRINE\nAFTER THE COLD WAR\nwww.setav.org\nANALYSIS	setav.org, Turkey

The development of more comprehensive marine forces, \nespecially amphibious combat units, was also prioritized. Additionally, PLAN \nmodified its focus to put more of an emphasis on creating information-driven, \nlong-range precision attack capabilities. In its white paper from 2006, the PLAN \naims to gradually increase the strategic depth for offshore defensive operations \nwhile emphasizing coordinated marine operations and strategic counterattacks. \nPLAN sought to build mobile marine forces, provide combined and integrated \nmaritime assistance, and enhance its overall capacity for operations in coastal	Modern Diplomacy - Fatima Arshad

Instead of utilizing any specific nomenclature for doctrine, Chinese \nmilitary scientists published the article under the categories “operational theory” \nand “operational practice.” Two essential components of PLA doctrine are the \nBasic Military Theory and the Applied Military Theory.

It elaborates the following 7 most \nimportant elements, that utilizes the Chinese military forces.\n•Our military’s overall approach is defensive. Only after being attacked do, we \nattack. But we engage in offensive actions.\n•“Neither time nor space will be a barrier to our counteroffensive.”\n•“We won’t set restrictions on how far our offensives can go.”\n•“When we do begin offensive operations, we will wait for the time and \ncircumstances that suit our forces.”	Modern Diplomacy - Fatima Arshad

Many of these problems are a \nresult of a conflict between China’s recent development of the capacity to \nchallenge some aspects of that dominance and the United States’ long-held \nconviction that maintaining military dominance in the western Pacific is \nnecessary. This conflict is primarily due to China’s deployment of increasingly \npotent “counter intervention” or anti access, area denial (A2/AD)-type weapons \nsystems along its maritime border.\nRegional and Global Ambitions\nThe People’s Republic of China is developing a potent naval force that will be \nable to manage its adjacent waterways, quell local disturbances, keep an eye on	Modern Diplomacy - Fatima Arshad

At \nits most basic level, active defense involves “taking tactically offensive \naction within a basically defensive strategy.”2 The parameters within \nwhich this strategy can be implemented are broad and can fall between \nthe “active” end of the spectrum and the “passive,” reactive end. The \noriginal goal of this strategy was to protect the PRC’s large cities and \nindustrial bases by using offensive operations to wear down an aggres-\nsor (in contrast to “passive defense”).3 As Chinese military capabili-\nties have improved over time, however, the active defense strategy has \nevolved from stressing the “defense” aspect to stressing the “active” \naspect in the form of a more offensively oriented strategy.4\n1 Blasko, 2006, pp. 95–96; Allen, Krumel, and Pollack, 1995, p. 23.\n2 Allen, Krumel, and Pollack, 1995, p. 24.

Mao’s fears of immi-\nnent global conflict in the 1960s and his advocacy of a strategy under \nwhich the tools of war would be manufactured in factories hidden in \nChina’s interior severely impeded the development of modern military \ncapabilities.5 Mao’s perceptions also motivated violent political upheav-\nals that occurred between 1958 and 1976.

At \nits most basic level, active defense involves “taking tactically offensive \naction within a basically defensive strategy.”2 The parameters within \nwhich this strategy can be implemented are broad and can fall between \nthe “active” end of the spectrum and the “passive,” reactive end. The \noriginal goal of this strategy was to protect the PRC’s large cities and \nindustrial bases by using offensive operations to wear down an aggres-\nsor (in contrast to “passive defense”).3 As Chinese military capabili-\nties have improved over time, however, the active defense strategy has \nevolved from stressing the “defense” aspect to stressing the “active” \naspect in the form of a more offensively oriented strategy.4\n1 Blasko, 2006, pp. 95–96; Allen, Krumel, and Pollack, 1995, p. 23.\n2 Allen, Krumel, and Pollack, 1995, p. 24.

Mao’s fears of immi-\nnent global conflict in the 1960s and his advocacy of a strategy under \nwhich the tools of war would be manufactured in factories hidden in \nChina’s interior severely impeded the development of modern military \ncapabilities.5 Mao’s perceptions also motivated violent political upheav-\nals that occurred between 1958 and 1976. These events—the Great \nLeap Forward (1958), the Sino-Soviet split (1960), and the Cultural \nRevolution (1966–1976)—adversely affected the PLAAF’s organiza-\ntional and operational development.6 After Mao’s death in 1976, the \nnet result of these political upheavals was a PLA that was weaker than \nit was in the 1950s, and one that stressed the defensive part of the \nactive defense strategy more than the active part.\nWith the rise of Deng Xiaoping and attendant economic and	Kholoud Mahmoud - Union Nikola Tesla University

india_Air_doctrine_1	India	Air	the Indo-Pacific region have undergone significant changes in their defense pos­\ntures. This is particularly the case with India, which has gone from a regional, \nlargely Pakistan-focused, perspective to one involving global influence and power \nprojection. This has presented ramifications for all the Indian armed services, but \nespecially the Indian Air Force (IAF). Over the last decade, the IAF has been trans­\nforming itself from a principally army-support instrument to a broad spectrum air \nforce, and this prompted a radical revision of Indian aipower doctrine in 2012. It is \nakin to Western airpower thought, but much of the latest doctrine is indigenous \nand demonstrates some unique conceptual work, not least in the way maritime air­\npower is used to protect Indian territories in the Indian Ocean and safeguard sea \nlines of communication.

Because of this, it is starting to have traction in Anglo-\nAmerican defense circles.1 The current Indian emphases on strategic reach and con­\nventional deterrence have been prompted by other events as well, not least the 1999 \nKargil conflict between India and Pakistan, which demonstrated that India lacked a \nbalanced defense apparatus. This article examines the evolving doctrinal thinking of \nthe IAF and argues that the service is transformational in the way it situates the use \nof airpower in addressing India’s security environment.2\nThe IAF is currently the fourth-largest air service in the world, with nearly \n1,500 aircraft, and, for this reason alone, it merits far greater attention than has \nbeen the case to date.3 But it is also one of the oldest independent air forces, hav­\ning been established in 1932. Since that time, it has been involved in a variety of\n22 | Journal of Indo-Pacific Affairs\nGoulter & Pant	Dr. Christina GoulterProf. Harsh Pant

However, in spite \nof this extensive experience, the IAF has lacked a comprehensive doctrine and bal­\nanced force structure and has primarily served two masters since its inception: the \nIndian Army and nuclear deterrence. This has had a variety of consequences, not \nleast a defensive and reactive posture. Since independence, India has done its ut­\nmost to prevent escalation of conflict with Pakistan and, in spite of numerous in­\ncursions into its territory, has managed to contain the violence.4 These engage­\nments between India and Pakistan, and, in one case, with China, should not be	Dr. Christina GoulterProf. Harsh Pant

In all other instances, \nthe Indian forces managed to turn the tide with the assistance of airpower. But \nwhat is also notable about all the conflicts up to the end of the 1990s is that les­\nsons over and above the tactical level were not taken on board, and a myopic focus \non Pakistan as a threat reinforced this tactical focus. As a result, most bases and air \nassets were positioned close to the Pakistani border. 6	Dr. Christina GoulterProf. Harsh Pant

As a result, most bases and air \nassets were positioned close to the Pakistani border. 6 \nIn other words, until the last decade, India has lacked a conventional deterrent \ncapability and the type of reach that would allow New Delhi to engage in power \nprojection, should the need arise. In view of the observation that half a century’s \nworth of experience seemed not to influence Indian airpower thinking much be­\nyond tactical effect, it is interesting to note that the last serious exchange between \nIndia and Pakistan during the Kargil War in 1999 appears to have galvanized In­\ndian thinking about the role of airpower. Events since 9/11 and the rise of China \nhave also compelled India to rethink conventional deterrence and redefine security \nwell beyond India’s borders and territorial waters. This can be seen as a response to \nChinese behaviors, in particular. For the last decade, China’s air strategy defines	Dr. Christina GoulterProf. Harsh Pant

For the last decade, China’s air strategy defines \nstrategic frontiers well beyond its own borders.7 However, the major step change in \nIndia’s defense posture occurred most markedly after the Kargil War, and one of \nthe most striking features of this change is the way in which airpower is viewed—\nboth as a strategic instrument and as a decisive instrument in its own right. It is, \ntherefore, worth examining the Kargil conflict briefly in order to understand why \nit exercised such influence over Indian thinking.\n24 | Journal of Indo-Pacific Affairs\nGoulter & Pant\nThere can be little doubt that the scale of the Pakistani incursion caused a strategic \nshock.

Although artillery exchanges in the Kargil sector had increased in frequency \nover the preceding two years, the region was considered a quiet zone in compari­\nson with others along the LOC. For the first two weeks of May, many senior com­\nmanders refused to believe that the incursion was performed by anyone other than \nmilitant insurgents, and briefings continued to refer to mujahedeen. The Indian \nArmy persisted in its belief that it was markedly stronger and more capable than \nthe Pakistanis, so the realization, when it finally came, that India had suffered a \nmajor incursion caused considerable psychological dislocation—not just at local \nunit level but, most significantly, among the senior military leadership.15 This dis­\nlocation manifested itself in a number of ways, not least in a lack of a joint re­\nsponse from the Indian armed forces.

The initial reports were kept within Army \ncircles, and as late as the morning of 10 May, the IAF’s Western Air Command \nstill knew nothing about the incursion. The only air support that was requested in \nthe early stages was at a local level, when calls were made for helicopter gunships. \nWhen it was pointed out by the local air commander that attack helicopters would \nbe extremely vulnerable to ground fire, especially Pakistani surface-to-air missiles \n(SAM), the Army vice-chief insisted that fast jet aviation would be inappropriate \nand potentially escalatory. At this point, the chief of the IAF, Air Chief Marshal \nAnil Tipnis, sought political approval for the use of fixed-wing offensive air­\npower.16 Permission was granted, as long as strikes were made inside Indian terri­\ntory, and not across the LOC.\nOffensive air operations began at first light on 26 May, two weeks after the first	Dr. Christina GoulterProf. Harsh Pant

Although no Indian air­\ncraft were lost to enemy fire after this point, the SAM threat remained high, and \nthe Pakistanis fired more than 100 SAMs in the course of the conflict.

Exacerbat­\ning the problems facing the aircrews was the paucity of intelligence. Not only had \nthere been a lack of joint air-land planning but the Army had also failed to pass on \nthe latest intelligence assessments of Pakistani strengths and dispositions. Much of \nthe intelligence being used by the IAF during the first weeks of the campaign was\nFall 2018 | 25\nRealignment and Indian Airpower Doctrine\nderived from its own aerial reconnaissance. In contrast to the Army’s own organic \naviation reconnaissance, which failed to detect any Pakistani activity in the previ­\nous months, the IAF’s imagery analysis had at least shown where most of the Paki­\nstani dispositions were, and electronic surveillance of the area provided useful sig­\nnals intelligence (SIGINT), in spite of the Pakistani’s increased signals security.20	Dr. Christina GoulterProf. Harsh Pant

In order to prevent the \nPakistan Air Force (PAF) from interfering with the fighting on the ground and In­\ndian air support, the IAF maintained combat air patrols along the full length of \nthe LOC and the Indo-Pakistani border, more widely.21 This was done as a precau­\ntion in case of a rapid escalation of the conflict. By this point, there was close coor­\ndination between the IAF and the Indian Army, and almost all the actions on the \nground were preceded by air strikes. To begin with, the IAF was employing un­\nguided weapons, but because of the problems with targeting in the mountainous \nterrain, the IAF quickly employed Mirage 2000H aircraft, which were capable of	Dr. Christina GoulterProf. Harsh Pant

The change to precision weapons played a signifi­\ncant role in swinging the campaign in India’s favor, and by mid-June, the Indian \nmountain divisions had recaptured the high ground that gave direct line of sight \nonto the national highway to the north. Another significant aerial action occurred \non 17 June, when IAF Mirages hit the Pakistanis’ main administrative and logistics \nhub at Muntho Dhalo, causing not just physical destruction but also dealing a ma­\njor blow to Pakistani morale.

As the weeks passed, the Indian mountain divisions recaptured \none post after another, and the only occasions on which air support was not pro­\nvided was when the weather precluded flying operations. Some strike operations \nwere done at night, which also added to the psychological pressure being applied \nto the Pakistanis, who had not anticipated round-the-clock air attacks. Air strikes \nended in mid-July, but other air support continued. This included several thou­\nsand helicopter sorties engaged in troop movement, air resupply, casualty evacua­\ntion, and heavy lift provided by Antinov-32 transport aircraft, which brought \n6,650 tons of materiel and 27,000 troops into the Kargil sector. The Pakistanis \nwere unable to match this level of sustainment and reinforcement, and, by 26 July, \nIndian forces had recaptured most of the posts, and almost all Pakistani units had \nwithdrawn to their side of the LOC.

The Indian counteroffensive had cost the \nArmy 471 killed and a further 1,060 wounded.22 The Pakistani casualties were\n26 | Journal of Indo-Pacific Affairs\nGoulter & Pant\nsubstantially more: over 700 killed and an estimated 1,000 wounded. Some \nsources suggest that these official Pakistani figures underplay the total losses by sev­\neral hundred.23 It is worth noting that, in spite of the difficulties the IAF experi­\nenced in targeting, there were no “blue-on-blue” incidents during the campaign, \nand the application of airpower had been both precise and proportionate.\nIn the decade that followed the Kargil War, the conflict became the subject for \nextensive study in both India and Pakistan and was seen as a watershed.24 It was \nrecognized as a unique conflict, not least because the two antagonists were nuclear-	Dr. Christina GoulterProf. Harsh Pant

Pakistan’s acquisition of nuclear weapons in 1998 had made the \ncountry bolder in its dealings with India, but both nations came away from the \nconflict impressed (and relieved) that they had succeeded in preventing a nuclear \nescalation. Up to that point, the accepted orthodoxy within Western political and \nmilitary circles was that nuclear-armed adversaries would avoid conflict at all costs \nfor fear of escalation to a nuclear level.25 The Kargil War defied that orthodoxy. \nThe failure of the nuclear deterrent in this case prompted a rethinking of nuclear \ndoctrine, but the conflict also spawned a new limited war concept, especially as far \nas India was concerned.26 For India, Kargil demonstrated that it was possible to \nengage in a limited conventional conflict without escalation to the nuclear level,	Dr. Christina GoulterProf. Harsh Pant
india_Air_doctrine_16	India	Air	as India was concerned.26 For India, Kargil demonstrated that it was possible to \nengage in a limited conventional conflict without escalation to the nuclear level, \nand this hurriedly prompted India to pursue the build-up of conventional forces \nin order to maintain its military-strategic advantage over Pakistan. As part of that \ndesire to dominate escalation in a conflict, India looked to airpower to provide the \nprincipal strategic advantage, and this posture was very clear from a number of ac­\ntions and pronouncements made by IAF seniors.27 Interestingly, the Pakistani anal­\nysis of the consequences of Kargil also drew a clear connection between the con­\nflict and the IAF’s modernization program. One PAF senior officer asserted that \nthe Kargil review report provided the basis for the IAF receiving the preponder­\nance of the 15-year defense spending plan (i.e. about $30 billion) for new multi­\nrole aircraft, including the Sukhoi Su-30MKI and French Rafale, as well as new	Dr. Christina GoulterProf. Harsh Pant

What differentiates this doctrine from its predecessor (published in 1995) \nis that it goes beyond outlining merely what airpower is, in terms of its roles, and \nexplains to a far greater extent what airpower is for.29 In contrast to the previous \nIAF doctrine, and, indeed, most Western airpower doctrine, the 2012 version\nFall 2018 | 27\nRealignment and Indian Airpower Doctrine\nmakes a much clearer connection between airpower and national security. Airpower \nis viewed as an indicator of national power and is defined as comprising the “sum \ntotal of a nation’s aviation and related capabilities,” including civilian assets.30 The	Dr. Christina GoulterProf. Harsh Pant
india_Air_doctrine_18	India	Air	is viewed as an indicator of national power and is defined as comprising the “sum \ntotal of a nation’s aviation and related capabilities,” including civilian assets.30 The \ninclusion of civilian assets is unusual in doctrinal terms, but it demonstrates that \nthe IAF is now thinking in a holistic way about national capability. Airpower is seen \nas serving Indian national interests across the full spectrum of conflict as well as tak­\ning a leading role in nation building and military diplomacy.\nHowever, perhaps the most unique conceptual work is displayed in the areas of \ncontrol of the air and strategic effect.31 Control of the air is seen not merely as the \nmost fundamental role of airpower (to protect the nation-state from attack) and a \nvital prerequisite for all other operations but also as the capability to defend a na­\ntion and provide freedom of maneuver as a deterrent in itself. This is a very impor­	Dr. Christina GoulterProf. Harsh Pant

This is a very impor­\ntant point overlooked in most other airpower doctrine. The IAF doctrine does not \ngo as far as some previous British airpower doctrine, which suggests that control of \nthe air is “an end in itself”; the argument the IAF puts forward is far more nu­\nanced.32 It sees deterrence and control of the air as inextricably intertwined; the \ncredibility of the air force is dependent upon the ability of that air force to maintain \ncontrol of the air, but the ability to control the airspace means little if the deterrent \nvalue of the air force is limited. The phrase deterrent air defense encapsulates what \nis intended.\nIt is also interesting to note that the IAF has retained the old doctrinal nomencla­\nture of degrees of control of the air.33 This has been dispensed with in most Western	Dr. Christina GoulterProf. Harsh Pant

However, it is under \nconsideration again now that state threats have come back into focus and the West \nis having to operate in parts of the world where air defense is well developed and \nde-confliction among various national air contingents may not be thoroughly \nworked out. The 2011 air campaign over Libya and recent operations against the \nIslamic State in Syria are good examples of this.34 During the Kargil operation, the \nIAF maintained air superiority adjacent to most of the LOC, but a persistent threat \nposed by SAMs meant that the IAF did not have air supremacy. The IAF’s control	Dr. Christina GoulterProf. Harsh Pant

The IAF’s control \nof the air was not absolute, but it possessed sufficient control in order to prosecute \nthe campaign it wished in order to dislodge the invaders.\nThere are several other aspects of control of the air that have been downplayed or \nomitted in Western doctrine since the end of the Cold War but feature in the latest \nIAF doctrine. One of these is protection of airfields. The IAF doctrine notes that\n28 | Journal of Indo-Pacific Affairs\nGoulter & Pant\nairfields are “densely packed, high-value targets. Aircraft on the ground at airfields \nare more concentrated and vulnerable than they are in flight.”35 With considerable \nprescience, these lines were written just prior to the major Taliban attack on Camp \nBastion, Afghanistan, in September 2012, which resulted in the loss of two US ser­	Dr. Christina GoulterProf. Harsh Pant

Since the end of the Cold War, several NATO nations \nhave had experiences of bases being attacked. During the closing stages of the con­\nflict in Iraq, for example, British Royal Air Force (RAF) aircraft came increasingly \nunder attack in Basra, causing the larger assets (such as the Nimrod maritime patrol \naircraft) to be withdrawn further back in theatre, and during 2007, the RAF lost a \nC-130 Hercules after an improvised explosive device detonated on the airfield at Al-	Dr. Christina GoulterProf. Harsh Pant

In both of these cases, the lesson supposedly learned was that no freedom \nof maneuver meant no airpower effect, or, at least, delayed airpower effect. One of \nthe reasons why such incidents seem not to have had much impact in the United \nKingdom may be because force protection is not addressed directly in the latest \nBritish airpower doctrine but is dealt with in subordinate operations manuals writ­\nten by the RAF Regiment. These manuals convey the importance of force protec­\ntion in a manner that should appear, at least briefly, in the main airpower doctrine. \nFor instance, the RAF Force Protection for Air Operations manual refers to the way \nin which force protection “is recognized, along with Air Logistics, as a key enabler \nfor Air and Space Power’s four fundamental roles.”37 This is one of several areas	Dr. Christina GoulterProf. Harsh Pant
india_Air_doctrine_24	India	Air	in which force protection “is recognized, along with Air Logistics, as a key enabler \nfor Air and Space Power’s four fundamental roles.”37 This is one of several areas \nwhere the IAF airpower doctrine is superior because it acknowledges that control of \nthe air includes protection of aircraft on the ground in the face of surface-to-surface \nthreats.\nHowever, the main reason the IAF doctrine has attracted attention in the West, \nparticularly in the United States, is its treatment of strategic effect and conventional \ndeterrence. The US interest stems from the fact that it is seeking to partner with na­\ntions that it regards as counterbalances to China, but it is also related to a new US \nfocus on tailored deterrence using nuclear and conventional means.38 In India, dis­\ncussions of strategic effect preceded the Kargil conflict, and, indeed, the subject ap­\npeared briefly in the previous IAF doctrine, but the conflict in 1999 prompted far	Dr. Christina GoulterProf. Harsh Pant

During the early to mid-2000s, many writers, \nseveral of whom were recently retired senior officers, underscored the importance of\nFall 2018 | 29\nRealignment and Indian Airpower Doctrine\nairpower in turning the tide during the Kargil conflict and how airpower provided \nthe best means of ensuring that India attains its place as a global player economi­\ncally.39 As far as India is concerned, the principal threat to this aspiration comes \nfrom China. Although Indo-Chinese relations improved for a time during the late \n1990s, military competition and distrust remain.

China engaged in what were con­\nsidered to be several provocative actions during the following decade, including the \nbuilding of SIGINT installations in the southern portion of the Tibetan plateau \nand in Aksai Chin, a disputed border area between the two countries. Chinese rapid \nreaction forces were also deployed close to the border. As a result, the IAF strength­\nened its Eastern Air Command, deploying Su30 Flankers there from 2008 onward. \nThe commander of the Eastern Air Force at the time, Air Marshal Pranab Kumar \nBarbora, made the point that this reinforcement was designed to thwart any “mis­\nadventure” by the Chinese and a repeat of the 1962 conflict.

Whereas India’s concept of defense used to focus purely on its borders, it \nnow envisages “strategic reach” to protect national interests, particularly economic, \ntrade, and energy security.41 Implicit in this strategic reach is deterrence; India is no \nlonger content to fight purely within its own borders when threatened and now \ntalks in terms of protecting its security interests at a continental level and extending \nits range also in the maritime sphere from the Persian Gulf to the Straits of Ma­\nlacca.42\nThis emphasis on strategic reach and strategic effect, more broadly, is a funda­	Dr. Christina GoulterProf. Harsh Pant

After half a century of viewing the IAF as a tactical \nsupport instrument, the 2012 doctrine seems to go almost to the opposite extreme. \nIt states “air power is inherently strategic in nature and its tactical application would \nonly fritter away its prime advantage of creating strategic effects.”43 Interestingly, the \ndoctrine makes a point of quoting some of Marshal of the RAF Lord Hugh \nTrenchard’s pronouncements from the 1920s, “It is not necessary for an air force, in \norder to defeat an enemy nation, to defeat its armed forces first. Air power can dis­\npense with that intermediate step, can pass over the enemy navies and armies, pen­\n30 | Journal of Indo-Pacific Affairs\nGoulter & Pant	Dr. Christina GoulterProf. Harsh Pant

One of these areas is the definition of strategic air effect. The \nIAF document makes the point that “the classification of an offensive air operation \nas ‘strategic’ is not determined by range, platform type or the weaponry used, but is \ndetermined by the objective or the purpose served.”45 Much of Western airpower \ndoctrine continues to conflate range or depth of penetration with “strategic.” For	Dr. Christina GoulterProf. Harsh Pant

One of the fallacies in Western discourse, especially since 2001, is that \nairpower is a purely supporting instrument in irregular warfare, and that airpower \ncannot have strategic effect in this setting.47 Although the 2012 IAF doctrine could \nhave expanded on this area a little more, it makes the point that key leadership tar­\ngeting has a strategic effect.48 It uses the US operation to kill Osama bin Laden in	Dr. Christina GoulterProf. Harsh Pant

The doctrine and senior \nIAF commentators make the point that a strategic strike capability without strategic \nairlift risks a gap in India’s ability to project power.49 Doubtless, the Kargil experi­\nence was informative here, as airlift was used to bring several divisions into the zone \nprior to the Indian counteroffensive, but airlift has been viewed as a lifeline to In­	Dr. Christina GoulterProf. Harsh Pant

Reference is made in several places throughout the \ndoctrine to airpower’s role in non-kinetic activity, and a whole chapter is devoted to \n“Nation Building, Aerial Diplomacy and Perception Management.”51 Western air­\nFall 2018 | 31\nRealignment and Indian Airpower Doctrine\npower doctrine, in contrast, has tended to emphasize kinetic effect when addressing \nstrategic airpower.

The short range \nof the aircraft concerned meant that the IAF could only perform air defense and \nArmy-support functions.54 However, the IAF’s modernization program is making \nsteady progress toward a strength of 42 squadrons by 2022, and the types of aircraft \nbeing procured indicate a serious intent to develop a balanced air force and a true \nstrategic capability.55 Three combat aircraft acquisition programs aim to provide a \nnew light combat aircraft (an indigenous design, the Tejas) to replace the aging \nMiG-21s, a multirole combat fighter (the French Rafale), and a fifth-generation	Dr. Christina GoulterProf. Harsh Pant

Although \nthe introduction of the Tejas has been slower than desired, the IAF expressed satis­\nfaction with its performance as a light multirole strike aircraft during recent exer­\ncises.56 In addition, the IAF is acquiring a fleet of 272 Su-30 fighter-bombers, Israeli \nairborne early warning aircraft, and air transport aircraft from the United States (in­\ncluding six C-130J Hercules, air-to-air refueling aircraft, and an unspecified num­\nber of C-17 Globemasters).57 These acquisitions will have not just force multiplier \neffects but synergies that will add to the deterrent value of the IAF.

Early warning \naircraft will not only enhance India’s air defense radius but will also play a key role \nin any expeditionary context. Similarly, refueling tanker aircraft will increase the \nrange and weapon loads of strike aircraft, thereby adding to India’s air deterrent.\nChallenges Facing Indian Airpower\nWhile greater thought is being applied as to how these aircraft are being ac­\nquired, one of the key weaknesses of the IAF has been the multiplicity of aircraft \ntypes in service. During the 1980s, for example, the IAF had no fewer than 11 dif­\nferent fighter aircraft, and this placed an unnecessary training and maintenance \nburden on the service.58 There may still be problems if the current modernization \nprogram persists with multinational procurement, not the least because the United \nStates’ increasingly strained relations with Russia may affect India’s relationship	Dr. Christina GoulterProf. Harsh Pant

After decades of deliberately pursuing a non-aligned \nposture, India has cultivated much closer ties with the United States, including\n32 | Journal of Indo-Pacific Affairs\nGoulter & Pant\nseveral high-profile joint exercises since 2004.59 But closer interaction with the \nUnited States may imperil India’s collaborative fifth-generation fighter aircraft \nproject with Russia. \nIn spite of the hurdles inherent in the IAF’s modernization program, the service \nhas at least received international recognition as a balanced, full-spectrum air \nforce. However, there remains one serious impediment to India’s desire for global \nreach and power projection—a flawed intelligence apparatus.

This is in contrast to most Western airpower \ndoctrine, which treats intelligence acquisition as one of the four main roles of air­\npower and how strategic effect, in particular, is dependent upon all-source analy­\nsis.63 Even allowing for Indian sensitivities over releasing too much information \nabout their intelligence machinery, to accord the subject just a few lines is a serious \nweakness in the doctrine.

Other nations’ airpower doctrine manages to address in­\ntelligence in generic terms, without compromising national security, and the IAF \nshould be able to do the same. \nIn the past, when countries have suffered strategic shock as a result of perceived \nor actual intelligence failure, not only is the intelligence apparatus overhauled but \nalso the significance of accurate and timely intelligence is usually impressed upon \nall organs of state, especially the military.64 For the IAF doctrine to downplay the \nrole of intelligence is not just dangerous, it is an oddity, because one of the conclu­\nsions drawn in the Kargil report was that India’s national surveillance capability \nwas “grossly inadequate,” particularly satellite and other imagery acquisition.65 The \nreport states that had India possessed high-definition satellite imagery capability, \nunmanned aerial vehicles, and better human intelligence, the Pakistani incursion	Dr. Christina GoulterProf. Harsh Pant

The report recommended that \nevery effort be made and adequate funds provided to ensure that a capability of \nworld standards was developed “indigenously and put in place in the shortest pos­\nsible time.”66 Therefore, it would be reasonable to expect the 2012 doctrine to, at \nleast, treat intelligence acquisition as a core role for airpower in a similar way to \nWestern airpower doctrine. One of the possible reasons why the doctrine devotes \nso little attention to the subject is that airpower, itself, is accorded surprisingly lit­\ntle attention in the Kargil report. The report tends to focus on the failures by the \nIndian defense-and-security apparatus, rather than addressing any success stories.	Dr. Christina GoulterProf. Harsh Pant

The report tends to focus on the failures by the \nIndian defense-and-security apparatus, rather than addressing any success stories. \nAs airpower was considered the principal factor explaining Indian success, it may \nhave been sidelined as a topic not demanding further investigation.67 If airpower\n34 | Journal of Indo-Pacific Affairs\nGoulter & Pant\nhad been found wanting, then it and air-derived intelligence may have been ad­\ndressed in more detail.\nNevertheless, the Kargil report does point to failings in service intelligence and \nsharing of intelligence among the services and intelligence agencies. Among the \nobservations made is that Indian air intelligence was lulled into a false sense of se­\ncurity. When Pakistani aircraft were located near the border just prior to the incur­\nsion, both army and air force intelligence assessed this activity as “normal.”68 \nEqually, reports of construction of helicopter bases were dismissed, as it was rea­	Dr. Christina GoulterProf. Harsh Pant

The operational level intelligence \napparatus also came in for criticism when it became apparent that there was some \ntactical intelligence suggesting that an invasion was imminent, but that the ana­	Dr. Christina GoulterProf. Harsh Pant

Because the Indian \nArmy lacked the means to sustain operations in winter weather at altitude, the as­\nsumption was made that the Pakistanis would not attempt major military opera­\ntions in that type of environment.72  \nMany writers consider Kargil to have been a systemic intelligence failure,73 but \nthis may be doing a disservice to parts of the intelligence machinery that func­\ntioned reasonably well. It is worth noting on which occasions and at what levels \nthe intelligence apparatus made the correct assessments. There is a suggestion in	Dr. Christina GoulterProf. Harsh Pant

There is a suggestion in \nthe Kargil report that the Indian Joint Intelligence Committee (JIC), which is re­\nsponsible for pan-government strategic assessments, did raise the possibility of a \nPakistani campaign in the Kargil zone in November 1998, some five months be­\nfore the incursion.74 The JIC also repeatedly pointed to an emboldened Pakistani \ngovernment that was likely to initiate a move in the Jammu and Kashmir region. \nThe Kargil report made the point that JIC assessments did not receive the atten­\ntion “they deserved at the political and higher bureaucratic levels. . . . The JIC was \nnot accorded the importance it deserved either by the intelligence agencies or the \nGovernment.”75 The question can be raised as to why the JIC’s assessments did not\nFall 2018 | 35\nRealignment and Indian Airpower Doctrine	Dr. Christina GoulterProf. Harsh Pant

The problem may have \nbeen the type of language used; assessments done by committee tend to reflect the \nlowest-common-denominator positions within the committee, leading to anodyne \nlanguage. It is, therefore, possible that the strategic indicators of an incursion by \nPakistan were not conveyed robustly enough. But writers who suggest that no stra­\ntegic assessments had been made are wrong.76 Equally, after the incursion became \napparent, the IAF did perform well in reconnaissance and imagery analysis. One \nof the IAF’s strengths is its adaptability, and as early as 10 May, the IAF’s recon­\nnaissance-and-surveillance assets were swung into action, including Jaguar fighters \nemployed in a reconnaissance role.77 Air-derived intelligence helped to bring clar­	Dr. Christina GoulterProf. Harsh Pant

There was surprisingly little communication between the Land \nand Air HQs, and during the first week after the incursion was detected, the In­\ndian Army attempted to respond alone. The Air Chief Marshal Tipnis recalled how \nthe Army’s Northern Command was reluctant to share reports on its initial artil­\nlery and small arms exchanges with the Pakistani forces. When the Army did en­\ngage with the local air officer commanding, the request was for helicopter gunships	Dr. Christina GoulterProf. Harsh Pant

When the Army did en­\ngage with the local air officer commanding, the request was for helicopter gunships \nto assist with the “eviction” of the “intruders.”78 It was pointed out that the alti­\ntudes at which air support would have to operate precluded the use of helicopters, \nand fast jet aviation was suggested as the only option, not least because if the situa­\ntion escalated, airpower was going to provide the best means of dealing with the \nsituation quickly. This was eventually agreed upon, after discussions between the \nservice chiefs, but valuable time was lost due to there being no formal process for \nair-land integration. Air Chief Marshal Tipnis commented that there was a total \nlack of Army-IAF joint staff work and no joint planning, not even joint delibera­\ntions at any command level, and this persisted for several weeks.79 However, once	Dr. Christina GoulterProf. Harsh Pant

One of the particu­\nlar strengths of the chapter is the way in which ideas are articulated; the language \nused is direct and very clear. The doctrine uses the word “jointmanship,” making it \na function of leadership. This is a vitally important point and a considerable ad­\nvance on most other doctrine. Second, it emphasizes that jointery is about true \npartnership and genuine respect for each service’s capabilities. The issue of respect \nis so often omitted in Western doctrine. It underscores mutual trust and confi­\ndence, as well as each service taking the time to learn and understand the strengths \nand weaknesses of other partners. The doctrine also emphasizes the importance of \nusing the appropriate tools at the right time. The issue of appropriateness is rarely \ndiscussed in Western doctrine. It is suggested that if all these factors are taken ac­	Dr. Christina GoulterProf. Harsh Pant

It is suggested that if all these factors are taken ac­\ncount of, then joint action will have synergistic and force multiplying effects, but \nthe point is also made that jointmanship needs to be exercised regularly, because \nthis is the only way to refine operating concepts. In short, this chapter articulates \nthe essential tenets of jointery in a way that is yet to be done properly in the West.\nAlthough some of the most unique conceptual work found in the IAF doctrine \nrelates to control of the air and strategic effect, the way in which air-surface inte­\ngration is treated is also noteworthy.82 A number of important observations are \nmade, including the psychological effect of air attacks on enemy troops and the \nfact that air interdiction of enemy supply lines can create strategic effect (the ex­	Dr. Christina GoulterProf. Harsh Pant

During the Kargil conflict, the attack \non the Pakistani logistics hub at Muntho Dhalo dealt a fatal blow to both Paki­\nstani morale and their ability to sustain their campaign, and these effects were \nhighlighted in the Kargil report.83 Clearly, this experience had a major impact on \nIAF thinking about the psychological effect of airpower and the significance of aer­\nial interdiction.\nHowever, perhaps most interesting is the IAF doctrine’s treatment of air-mari­\ntime operations. Unusually, India employs its navy for maritime reconnaissance,	Dr. Christina GoulterProf. Harsh Pant

Unusually, India employs its navy for maritime reconnaissance, \nbut the strike function has been given to the air force. Of particular note is the \nway in which a distinction is drawn between anti-shipping strike and maritime \nstrike.84 The former is aimed at the enemy’s naval assets in proximity to Indian \nforces, while the latter is aimed at enemy targets that are not in contact with \nfriendly forces, and included in this category are enemy naval facilities in harbor\nFall 2018 | 37\nRealignment and Indian Airpower Doctrine\nand maritime patrol aircraft on the ground. This distinction between anti-shipping \nstrike and maritime strike is unique and is akin to the distinction made in Western \nairpower doctrine between close air support (the targeting of enemy troops in con­\ntact with friendly forces) and air interdiction (the targeting of enemy supply lines,	Dr. Christina GoulterProf. Harsh Pant
india_Air_doctrine_54	India	Air	airpower doctrine between close air support (the targeting of enemy troops in con­\ntact with friendly forces) and air interdiction (the targeting of enemy supply lines, \nreserves, and troops not in the immediate battlespace). The main point, however, \nis that the IAF doctrine dedicates far more space to this subject than most Western \nairpower doctrine, certainly the British equivalents since the 1990s, which have \nsteadily decreased the attention given to anti-shipping (or maritime strike) roles.85  \nWhat the authors of the Indian airpower doctrine appreciate, while their coun­\nterparts in the West seem not to, is that one of the roles of air doctrine is to high­\nlight how airpower should be used or could be used, if the nation possesses all the \nresources it requires. One of the traps into which British doctrine, in particular, \nhas fallen is to downplay or disregard certain functions of airpower when the	Dr. Christina GoulterProf. Harsh Pant

One of the traps into which British doctrine, in particular, \nhas fallen is to downplay or disregard certain functions of airpower when the \ncountry has lacked particular assets. This is certainly the case with maritime avia­\ntion. In the late 1990s, after the RAF dispensed with its two Tornado squadrons \ndevoted to an anti-shipping role, no mention was made of a maritime-strike func­\ntion in RAF doctrine.86 Similarly, the axing of the Nimrod maritime patrol aircraft \nafter the Strategic Defence Review of 2010 led to the maritime reconnaissance-\nand-surveillance function being dropped from the 2013 doctrine, just as strategic \neffect disappeared from British air doctrine in the fourth edition simply because \nthe operational context was, apparently, all about COIN warfare at the time. In \nother words, doctrine of any service type needs to deal in some universal constants \nand should not be overly swayed by either operational contexts or available capa­	Dr. Christina GoulterProf. Harsh Pant

A certain proportion of any doctrine also has aspirational elements to it, \nand some of the IAF doctrine falls into this category. The IAF doctrine optimisti­\ncally predicts that air force and carrier aviation will be able to meet both regional \nand out-of-area defense requirements, so long as operations are properly coordi­\nnated and planned.87 \nConclusion\nIt is clear from the 2012 doctrine that the IAF sees itself as an instrument of \npower projection and underpinning expeditionary capability, but it also recognizes \nthat it is the principal tool in India’s armory if deterrence fails.88 It is also clear that \nthe Kargil experience was extremely important in crystalizing Indian thinking \nabout the utility of airpower. For India, the overriding lessons from 1999 were that	Dr. Christina GoulterProf. Harsh Pant

For India, the overriding lessons from 1999 were that \nthe nation had paid a heavy price for its failure to invest properly in conventional\n38 | Journal of Indo-Pacific Affairs\nGoulter & Pant\ndeterrence, a balanced force structure and intelligence, but that airpower had been \nthe chief factor in turning the tide in its favor. Since then, Pakistan has been reluc­\ntant to engage in major adventurism (even if border skirmishes continue). There­\nfore, it is difficult to agree with some writers who suggest that the IAF’s expanded \ncapability is causing more, not less, instability in South Asia.89 The IAF’s modern­\nization program has been transformative, not merely in material and training \nterms but also in the conceptual realm.

While some flaws in the airpower doctrine \nremain, not least in how intelligence is treated, the 2012 doctrine is revolutionary \non many levels. This transformation has ensured new, strong international partner­\nships that have, in turn, added to the deterrent value of the IAF. JIPA	Dr. Christina GoulterProf. Harsh Pant

iran_Military_doctrine_0	Iran	Military	Iran’s Military Doctrine \nMichael Connell \n \n The Iran-Iraq War (1980-1988) was a defining moment for the Iranian \nmilitary and it continues to underpin many aspects of Iranian military \ndoctrine. \n \n Iranian military planners are adept at incorporating lessons from other \nconflicts, such as the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq and the 2006 war between \nIsrael and Hezbollah, to refine their own doctrines and strategies.  \n \n To challenge a technologically superior adversary, such as the United \nStates, Iranian doctrine emphasizes aspects of asymmetric warfare that \nplay to Iran’s strengths, including geography, strategic depth and public \nwillingness to accept casualties. \n \n The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), the branch of the Iranian \nmilitary tasked with protecting the Islamic revolution, is undergoing a \nmajor restructuring to enhance its survivability and give regional \ncommanders more flexibility to respond to potential threats. \n \nOverview	Iran’s Military Doctrine Michael Connell
iran_Military_doctrine_1	Iran	Military	major restructuring to enhance its survivability and give regional \ncommanders more flexibility to respond to potential threats. \n \nOverview \nIranian military doctrine constitutes a unique hybrid of western \n(especially U.S.) military concepts coupled with ideological tenets, including \nmartyrdom and revolutionary zeal. Since the 1979 revolution, Iranian military \ndoctrine has continued to evolve and adapt with the regime’s shifting threat \nperceptions and regional political developments.  \n  \nIran’s armed forces have tailored their war-fighting strategies to counter \ntechnologically superior adversaries, such as the United States. Tacitly \nacknowledging it has little chance of winning a conventional force-on-force \nconflict, Iran has opted for deterrence-based model of attrition warfare that raises \nan opponent's risks and costs, rather than reducing its own. The goal is to inflict \na psychological defeat that inhibits an enemy’s willingness to fight.	Iran’s Military Doctrine Michael Connell
iran_Military_doctrine_2	Iran	Military	an opponent's risks and costs, rather than reducing its own. The goal is to inflict \na psychological defeat that inhibits an enemy’s willingness to fight. \n \nAsymmetric warfare plays a central role in Iranian military theory. Iran’s \narmed forces appear to be focusing on the development of niche capabilities that \nplay to Iranian strengths—manpower, strategic depth and a willingness to accept \ncasualties—while exploiting the weaknesses of Iran’s adversaries, who are \nregarded as risk averse, casualty sensitive and heavily dependent on technology \nand regional basing facilities for access. \n  \nDoctrine evolution\nThe basis of Iranian military doctrine was developed during Iran’s long \nand traumatic war with Iraq (1980-1988). Most senior officers are veterans of the \n“imposed war,” which has had a major influence on Iranian strategic thinking. \nConcepts such as self-reliance, “holy defense,” and export of the revolution first	Iran’s Military Doctrine Michael Connell
iran_Military_doctrine_3	Iran	Military	“imposed war,” which has had a major influence on Iranian strategic thinking. \nConcepts such as self-reliance, “holy defense,” and export of the revolution first \nentered the military lexicon during the Iran-Iraq War and were codified as \ndoctrine in the early 1990s. These ideas mingled with concepts from pre-\nrevolutionary doctrine, which was heavily influenced by the United States, to \nform a unique hybrid that distinguished modern Iranian military doctrine from \nits largely Soviet-inspired counterparts in the Arab world. \n  \nAfter the war, Tehran gradually scaled back its efforts to export its \nrevolution. As its foreign policy goals shifted, Iran’s national security strategy \nalso became more defensive. Iranian military strategists began to pay more \nattention to the principles of modern maneuver warfare, such as combined and \njoint operations. In the mid-1990s, there was even talk about merging the IRGC \nwith the regular military, the Artesh, to alleviate the command and control-	Iran’s Military Doctrine Michael Connell

If such Russian aggression is tolerated, it could send a message with \nthe wrong implication that unilateral changes to the status quo by force are acceptable in other regions as \nwell, including Asia. Therefore, the international community, including Japan, should never tolerate Russia’s action.	HAMADA Yasukazu, Minister of Defense

In the mid-1990s, there was even talk about merging the IRGC \nwith the regular military, the Artesh, to alleviate the command and control-\nrelated problems of having two parallel military services operating in tandem. \nIran’s military capabilities still lagged behind its doctrine, but by the end of the \ndecade, its forces were gradually evolving into professional, Western-style \nmilitaries.  \n \nThe 9/11 attacks and U.S. invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan led Tehran to \nreconsider the trajectory of its armed forces. The regional security environment \nhad changed drastically. Ba’athist Iraq and Taliban Afghanistan—two of Iran’s \nmain rivals—were no longer a threat. But the United States suddenly had troops \npositioned along both its western and eastern flanks. This confluence of events, \ncoupled with rumblings in Washington about opportunities for regime change, \nled Tehran to reassess its national security strategy. Iran’s armed forces began to	Iran’s Military Doctrine Michael Connell
iran_Military_doctrine_5	Iran	Military	coupled with rumblings in Washington about opportunities for regime change, \nled Tehran to reassess its national security strategy. Iran’s armed forces began to \ntailor their strategies specifically to counter the perceived U.S. threat. \n \nLand warfare doctrine \n \nIn 2005, the IRGC announced that it was incorporating a flexible, layered \ndefense —referred to as a mosaic defense—into its doctrine. The lead author of \nthis plan was General Mohammad Jafari, then director of the IRGC’s Center for \nStrategy, who was later appointed commander of the IRGC. \n \nAs part of the mosaic defense, the IRGC has restructured its command \nand control architecture into a system of 31 separate commands—one for the city \nof Tehran and 30 for each of Iran’s provinces. The primary goal of restructuring \nhas been to strengthen unit cohesion at the local level and give commanders \nmore latitude to respond to potential threats—both foreign and domestic. But the	Iran’s Military Doctrine Michael Connell
iran_Military_doctrine_6	Iran	Military	has been to strengthen unit cohesion at the local level and give commanders \nmore latitude to respond to potential threats—both foreign and domestic. But the \nnew structure would also make it difficult for hostile forces to degrade Iranian\ncommand and control, a lesson the Iranian military has learned by analyzing U.S. \noperations in Iraq, Afghanistan and the Balkans. \n \nThe mosaic defense plan allows Iran to take advantage of its strategic \ndepth and formidable geography to mount an insurgency against invading \nforces. Most of Iran’s population centers and major lines of communication are \nspread out within the interior of the country. Iran’s borders are ringed by rugged \nmountain ranges that serve as natural barriers to invasion. As enemy supply \nlines stretched into Iran’s interior, they would be vulnerable to interdiction by \nspecial stay-behind cells, which the IRGC has formed to harass enemy rear \noperations.

iran_Military_doctrine_7	Iran	Military	lines stretched into Iran’s interior, they would be vulnerable to interdiction by \nspecial stay-behind cells, which the IRGC has formed to harass enemy rear \noperations.   \n \nThe Artesh, a mix of armored, infantry and mechanized units, would \nconstitute Iran’s initial line of defense against invading forces. IRGC troops \nwould support this effort, but they would also form the core of popular \nresistance, the bulk of which would be supplied by the Basij, the IRGC’s \nparamilitary volunteer force. The IRGC has developed a wartime mobilization \nplan for the Basij, called the Mo’in Plan, according to which Basij personnel \nwould augment regular IRGC units in an invasion scenario. \n \nIRGC and Basij exercises have featured simulated ambushes on enemy \narmored columns and helicopters. Much of this training has been conducted in \nan urban environment, suggesting that Iran intends to lure enemy forces into \ncities where they would be deprived of mobility and close air support. Iran has	Iran’s Military Doctrine Michael Connell
iran_Military_doctrine_8	Iran	Military	an urban environment, suggesting that Iran intends to lure enemy forces into \ncities where they would be deprived of mobility and close air support. Iran has \nemphasized passive defense measures—techniques used to enhance the \nbattlefield survivability —including camouflage, concealment and deception. \n \nNaval doctrine \n \nTehran views maritime combat operations much the same way as it views \nland-based operations. Iranian naval doctrine is geared toward confronting a \ntechnologically superior adversary—often assumed to be the U.S. Navy—with a \nform of guerrilla warfare at sea. The bases of this doctrine were developed \nduring the Tanker War (1984-1988), during which Iran used aircraft, speedboats, \nsea mines and land-based anti-ship cruise missiles to attack civilian tanker \nshipping in the Persian Gulf. After a U.S. frigate, the Samuel B. Roberts, was badly \ndamaged by an Iranian mine, the U.S. Navy retaliated with Operation Praying	Iran’s Military Doctrine Michael Connell

Roberts, was badly \ndamaged by an Iranian mine, the U.S. Navy retaliated with Operation Praying \nMantis (1988), destroying two Iranian oil platforms and sinking several Iranian \nsurface vessels, including a corvette, a guided missile patrol craft and smaller \ngunboats.  \n  \nAfter Operation Praying Mantis, Iran apparently determined that its \nmaritime forces would not be as effective in a conventional force-on-force naval \nconflict with adversaries such as the United States. Incorporating lessons learned\nfrom the Tanker War, the IRGC Navy (IRGCN) and, to a lesser degree, the \nregular Navy (IRIN) developed an asymmetric strategy based on avoiding direct \nor sustained confrontations at sea. It instead relies on surprise attacks, ambushes \nand hit-and-run operations. Rather than inflict a decisive defeat, Iran’s maritime \nforces would seek to inflict enough causalities to raise the cost of victory to an \nunpalatable level.	Iran’s Military Doctrine Michael Connell
iran_Military_doctrine_10	Iran	Military	and hit-and-run operations. Rather than inflict a decisive defeat, Iran’s maritime \nforces would seek to inflict enough causalities to raise the cost of victory to an \nunpalatable level. \n \nIran’s naval doctrine relies on a layered defense and massing of firepower, \nintegrating multiple sea, land and air-based weapons simultaneously to \noverwhelm and confuse adversaries. As Iran’s naval doctrine has matured, the \nIranians have acquired a large inventory of naval materiel suitable for \nasymmetric warfare. This includes naval mines, which can be covertly deployed \nusing small boats or commercial vessels; land and sea-based anti-ship cruise \nmissiles; small fast-attack craft, which can engage in swarming operations or \nsuicide attacks; and submarines, including three Russian-supplied KILO-class \ndiesel-electric submarines and numerous North Korean and domestically \nproduced midget submarines, which can be used in the Gulf’s shallow areas.

iran_Military_doctrine_11	Iran	Military	diesel-electric submarines and numerous North Korean and domestically \nproduced midget submarines, which can be used in the Gulf’s shallow areas.  \n \nGeography is a key element in Iranian naval planning. The Gulf’s \nconfined space, which is less than 100 nautical miles wide in many places, limits \nthe maneuverability of large surface assets, such as aircraft carriers. But it plays \nto the strengths of Iran’s naval forces, especially the IRGCN. The Gulf’s northern \ncoast is dotted with rocky coves ideally suited for terrain masking and small boat \noperations. The Iranians have also fortified numerous islands in the Gulf that sit \nastride major shipping lanes. \n \nIran has developed a strategy to deny hostile navies access to the Persian \nGulf that focuses on the strategically sensitive Strait of Hormuz. This strategic \nmaritime chokepoint is only 29 nautical miles wide at its narrowest point. Iranian \nofficials have hinted that they might close the strait during a conflict, thereby	Iran’s Military Doctrine Michael Connell
iran_Military_doctrine_12	Iran	Military	maritime chokepoint is only 29 nautical miles wide at its narrowest point. Iranian \nofficials have hinted that they might close the strait during a conflict, thereby \ntemporarily cutting off as much as 30 percent of the world’s oil supply. But \nclosing the strait would also cause tremendous economic damage for the \nIranians, so they are not likely to undertake such a measure lightly. Given the \nstrait’s importance, however, disrupting maritime traffic in it or even threatening \nto do so would be an effective tool for Iran to pressure neighbors and intimidate \nfoes. \n  \nAir and air defense doctrine \nIranian air and air defense doctrine is focused on defending Iranian \nairspace and deterring aggression, although certain Iranian aircraft, such as the \nSu-24 fighter-bomber, can be used in an offensive capacity. Surface-to-air missiles \n(SAMs) and interceptor aircraft—most of which belong to the regular Islamic \nRepublic of Iran Air Force (IRIAF)—both play an important role in this effort.

iran_Military_doctrine_13	Iran	Military	(SAMs) and interceptor aircraft—most of which belong to the regular Islamic \nRepublic of Iran Air Force (IRIAF)—both play an important role in this effort.\nIran’s pilots are among the best trained in the region. They continue to use U.S. \ntraining manuals and employ U.S. tactics—a legacy of U.S.-Iranian military \nexchanges during the shah’s rule.  \n \nThe IRIAF and the Air Defense Force, a separate command within the \nArtesh, face numerous challenges in defending Iranian air space. In this case, \ngeography is a limiting factor, given the size of Iran and its mountainous terrain, \nwhich tend to produce gaps in radar coverage. For the IRIAF, aging and \noutdated equipment remains another problem. Many aircraft in the IRIAF’s \ninventory, including mainstays such as the F-14A and the F-4D, were supplied \nby the United States before the 1979 revolution. Some of these platforms have \nbeen kept running, either by cannibalizing parts from other aircraft or procuring	Iran’s Military Doctrine Michael Connell

Some of these platforms have \nbeen kept running, either by cannibalizing parts from other aircraft or procuring \nspare parts on the black market, but IRIAF readiness levels are assumed to be \nlow due to maintenance issues. \n \nIran has managed to acquire several batteries of the advanced Tor-M1 \nmedium altitude SAM system from the Russians, but its air defense capabilities \nremain limited. As of mid-2010, efforts to buy the advanced long-range SA-300 \nSAM from the Russians had failed. Iran also lacks an integrated air defense \nnetwork or the ability to engage air-to-air targets beyond visual range. \n  \nAs a result of these challenges, Iran’s military has opted to use its limited \nair and air defense assets to protect high-value point targets, including Tehran \nand the country’s nuclear facilities. Iranian pilots have been trained to \ncompensate for the limitations of their aircraft, avionics and weapons systems by	Iran’s Military Doctrine Michael Connell

Iranian pilots have been trained to \ncompensate for the limitations of their aircraft, avionics and weapons systems by \nusing advanced tactics, such as terrain masking, to ambush enemy aircraft \nwithout being detected. Iran’s air and air defense forces have also attempted to \naugment the survivability of their units with passive defense measures, \nincluding asset dispersion and the use of forward operating bases, hardened \nshelters and hidden installations. \n \nBallistic missile doctrine \n \nIran’s ballistic missile program dates back to the middle of the 1980s, \nduring the Iran-Iraq War. For Tehran, Iraq’s use of ballistic missiles against \nIranian strategic targets highlighted a critical vulnerability in Iran’s defenses; it \nalso demoralized Iran’s civilian population. To deter Iraq from attacking its \npopulation centers and strategic industries, Iran initiated its own ballistic missile	Iran’s Military Doctrine Michael Connell
iran_Military_doctrine_16	Iran	Military	also demoralized Iran’s civilian population. To deter Iraq from attacking its \npopulation centers and strategic industries, Iran initiated its own ballistic missile \nprogram, beginning with the initial shipment of a limited number of SCUD-B \nmissiles from Libya. By the end of the war, Iran had launched over 100 ballistic \nmissiles at Iraqi targets in what would become known as the “War of the Cities.”  \n \nIran’s strategic missile forces are now key to its deterrence strategy, in part \nbecause they are implicitly linked to Iran’s weapons of mass destruction\nprograms. In 2010, Iran had the largest inventory of ballistic missiles in the \nMiddle East. The IRGC, which has operational control over Iran’s missile forces, \ncontinues to extend the range and improve the performance of its ballistic \nmissiles, several classes of which can range Israel and the Gulf countries. Their \nlimited accuracy suggests they would not be useful in a conventional counter-	Iran’s Military Doctrine Michael Connell

Their \nlimited accuracy suggests they would not be useful in a conventional counter-\nforce role. Instead, they are probably intended for strategic targets such as cities, \noil production and export facilities, ports and water desalinization plants.  \n \nThe future  \n Iranian military doctrine is primarily defensive in nature and based on \ndeterring perceived adversaries. Iran is therefore unlikely to seek a direct, \nforce-on-force confrontation with the United States.  \n \n However, there is ample room for miscommunication between Iranian \nand U.S. forces at the tactical and operational levels. The recent push to \ndecentralize command and control within the IRGC could have \nunintended consequences in terms of escalation, especially in the Persian \nGulf. \n \n For the foreseeable future, lack of coordination between the IRGC and the \nArtesh is likely to remain a key weak point in terms of Iranian military	Iran’s Military Doctrine Michael Connell

To respond to this severe security environment, Japan formulated \nthe National Security Strategy of Japan (NSS), the National Defense Strategy of Japan (NDS), and the Defense Buildup Program (DBP) in December 2022. These are \nthought to mark a major turning point in Japan’s postwar defense policy, enabling the fundamental reinforcement of necessary defense capabilities and creating a \ndefense architecture that can truly protect the people.\nThe NSS is positioned as Japan’s supreme national security policy document. It outlines the Government’s strategy to respond with a whole-of-government \napproach in a wide range of areas including economic security, technology, and intelligence, in addition to the traditional areas of diplomacy and defense. In particular,	HAMADA Yasukazu, Minister of Defense

To this end, the NDS establishes a policy for the fundamental reinforcement of defense capabilities, including the possession of \ncounterstrike capabilities.\nAs for the functions and capabilities required for defense, Japan will first strengthen its (i) stand-off defense capabilities and (ii) integrated air and missile defense \ncapabilities, in order to disrupt and defeat invading forces from a long distance, thereby deterring an invasion of Japan itself.

At \nthe same time, diplomacy needs to be backed by defense capabilities.
